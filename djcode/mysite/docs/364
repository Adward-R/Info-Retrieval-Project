Referee designations for matches 49 and 50 
FIFA has announced the referees for the FIFA World Cup™ matches 49 and 50 in which four South American teams will compete in the first of the Round of 16 matches. 
England’s Howard Webb will officiate Brazil-Chile, to be played in Belo Horizonte. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, where Webb was in charge of the final, the 42-year-old oversaw the identical encounter: Brazil’s 3-0 win over Chile in the Round of 16. 
Meanwhile at the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ he has already refereed the group-stage match Colombia-Cote d’Ivoire. Further highlights in his career were two FIFA Confederations Cups (2009 and 2013), two European Championships (2008 and 2012) and the 2012 UEFA Champions League final.  
The second Round of 16 match, Colombia-Uruguay, will be overseen by 41-year-old Björn Kuipers from the Netherlands. So far in this competition, Kuipers has refereed the matches England-Italy and Switzerland-France.  
A few weeks before, he was in charge of the UEFA Champions League final, one of the six international deciders he has refereed in total - namely the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013, Europa League 2013, UEFA Super Cup 2012, UEFA EURO U-21 Championship 2009 and the UEFA EURO U-17 Championship 2006.
