Giant dolls take Recife by storm
The giant dolls that have been a central feature of carnival in the city of Olinda in Pernambuco state for nearly 100 years are playing their part at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™.  Special versions of the puppets, resembling the leading stars of Brazil 2014, have been made for the event and are keeping the fans entertained at the FIFA Fan Fest™ in Recife. 
While Olinda’s larger-than-life puppets have traditionally been made with wood and papier-mâché, this latest generation of World Cup-themed dolls has been shaped from carbon fibre and clay instead. The result is a better overall finish, a definite likeness to the players and a lot less weight for the person inside to carry. 
Created by a team of 150 people and striving for a genuine resemblance to the stars of the tournament, the remarkable designs can be seen on the streets of Recife and right here at
