Statement by Thierry Weil, FIFA’s Marketing Director and responsible for Ticketing at FIFA
With regard to “Operation Jules Rimet”, FIFA is fully supporting the local authorities in their investigations into ticket scalping and any illegal sale of FIFA World Cup™ tickets. FIFA’s ticketing experts will tomorrow (Friday, 4 July 2014) analyse the seized tickets in order to validate them as well as to assist the authorities in identifying the source of the tickets and track down the channels of those tickets. FIFA and the local authorities will ensure that any violations will be sanctioned accordingly. 



FIFA takes a firm stance against any form of violation of the ticketing regulations and is very pleased with the great collaboration with the security authorities in our joint efforts to clamp down any unauthorized ticket sales. 



Furthermore, FIFA wants to confirm that Mohamadou Lamine Fofana was never accredited for the FIFA World Cup nor had any access to any official car pool of the FIFA World Cup. 



Please understand that we cannot comment further as the proceedings are ongoing.
