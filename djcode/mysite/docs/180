Referees for the final four matches announced
Under the chairmanship of Jim Boyce, the FIFA Referees Committee has confirmed the list of referees that will be used to cover the last four matches of 2014 FIFA World Cup™. In total, 15 out of the 25 referee trios will remain in Brazil and are available for selection for these matches. The committee defined the list after careful monitoring of all referees and assistant referees on a daily basis together with the technical staff. In line with how designations have been made throughout the tournament, quality was the main criteria while physical, medical and technical aspects were also taken into consideration.  
FIFA’s Head of Refereeing Massimo Busacca took the opportunity to thank the entire referee team before departures started on Monday.  
“As the tournament draws to a close, I would like to say thank you to all of the match officials – the 25 trios and the eight support duos – for their contributions. Considering what is at stake in each and every World Cup match, with the eyes of millions watching on, I want to praise the entire team for the way they’ve conducted themselves and gone about their work as professionals. Overall I’m pleased with the performances and the effort put in. We have also been looking out for key learnings as part of the debriefs and thorough analysis of the trainings and matches,” said Massimo Busacca, FIFA’s Head of Refereeing.
