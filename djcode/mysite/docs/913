Immobile and Insigne hoping to feature against England
Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne could lead Italy's attack when the 
open their FIFA World Cupâ„¢ campaign against England on Saturday. The former Pescara team-mates started in Sunday's 5-3 triumph over Brazilian club side Fluminense and accounted for all of the Italian's goals at Volta Redonda. 
Immobile, who scored a hat-trick against Fluminense, was the top scorer in Serie A this season with Torino and has sealed a move to Borussia Dortmund. Napoli striker Insigne is also coming off a strong campaign and has now boosted his chances of being in the starting XI ahead of Mario Balotelli and Antonio Cassano. 
"The coach will make his choices, we just have to work hard and give our contribution, even if we come off the bench," Immobile said to 
. 
"I was really excited after scoring the first goal so you can imagine finishing with a hat-trick. It's always important to score even if it is not in an official game. Now we have to be ready for England." 
Insigne and Immobile have done very well. They have set an example in attack.
Cesare Prandelli, Italy coach
Insigne was delighted to play alongside Immobile again. He said: "We know each other well so for us it's much easier to play together." 
He added: "The fact that we gave away three goals is not important because the result was not important. The outcome that will be crucial is against England. They are a strong side and we will have to use our best weapons." 
The 
had gone into the contest without a win in their previous seven games and Italy coach Cesare Prandelli was very encouraged by their performance. 
"We have seen interesting things, especially in attack," said Prandelli. "Insigne and Immobile have done very well. They have set an example in attack."
