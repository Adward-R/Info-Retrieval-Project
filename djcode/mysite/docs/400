Resignation not an option for Bento
Portugal coach Paulo Bento has insisted that he would not resign if his country become the latest European nation to crash out of the FIFA World Cupâ„¢.
 
The Iberian outfit play Ghana in Group G tomorrow knowing they need a big win to even maintain their slight hopes of stopping Germany and USA taking the two qualifying spots for the Round of 16. 
"Whatever happens in tomorrow's match, I will not resign from my post as coach," Bento told a press conference. 
"That is not my intention. It is not the intention of the federation and not the intention of its president. With that, everything has been said." 
Portugal's 4-0 hammering by Germany and narrow 2-2 draw against USA have increased pressure on the team, who Bento admitted face "an extremely complicated situation" going into Thursday's match. 
"We have to win and then we will see," he said. "We have a match to play, the United States and Germany have a match to play. 
"We must choose a strategy against a team [Ghana] that is technically advanced, physically very strong, with players that are fast on the counter-attack, a team that is going to get involved and try to qualify."
