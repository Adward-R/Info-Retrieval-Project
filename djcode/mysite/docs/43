Messi: This is the match of our lives
 
Rio de Janeiro’s famous Maracana is the setting as Messi attempts to emulate his idol Diego Maradona by leading his team to victory against Germany, in front of 73,500 fans and an estimated global television audience of around one billion.  
 
"Tomorrow, we will play the most important match of our lives for our country," Messi wrote in a rousing message on his official Facebook page. "My dreams and my hopes are being fulfilled due to the hard work and sacrifice of a team that has given everything from match one. 
"We knew it was possible. Our people, the Argentines, they have carried us here. But the dream is not over yet. Tomorrow we want to win, and we are ready!" 
 
"Germany are always very strong physically and tactically,” he said. “For that reason they are the team that has won most titles along with Brazil and Italy. They use the ball very well and play the ball between the lines. They also use the space behind full-backs very well, especially with (Philipp) Lahm. We have to play a perfect match." 
Sabella acknowledged the similarities between Sunday's final and the climax to the 1986 tournament, when Maradona led Argentina to a 3-2 victory over West Germany. "It is true there are certain parallels and we hope the situation repeats  itself against a very strong opponent," he said.
