Referee designations for matches 21-23
FIFA has announced the referees for the FIFA World Cup™ matches 21 to 23.
 
The match between Colombia and Côte d’Ivoire will be refereed by Howard Webb, the first appearance of the 42-year-old Englishman who refereed the FIFA World Cup Final in 2010. He earned his international credentials in 2005 and since then has already participated in several international competitions, including two FIFA Confederations Cups (2009 and 2013) and the last two European Championships. 
When Japan meet Greece, both teams who lost their first encounters, the contest will be officiated by Joel Aguilar, 38 and from El Salvador. He has already refereed at the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro in the city’s first match of the competition, bringing with him a vast amount of experience gained within CONCACAF. He has also covered several other FIFA competitions, including the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 and the FIFA Club World Cup 2011. 
Match 23, Uruguay against England, also two teams who lost their first matches, will be refereed by Carlos Velasco Carballo. The 43-year-old Spaniard has already officiated at matches during UEFA EURO 2012 and the FIFA Club World Cup 2013. In 2009, he was the man-in-the-middle for the Egyptian league title play-off.
