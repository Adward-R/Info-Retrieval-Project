Global stars react to Mineirazo
Global reaction to Germany's record-breaking 7-1 rout of Brazil in the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ semi-finals on Tuesday has been widespread. Here are just some of the comments from the football world.  
It will be difficult to recover. Some players I don't think will be back to wear the Brazilian shirt. It is wrong now to criticise the players. On the field, Germany taught us how to play football. We have to learn from that.


 



 
What was that? Hard to believe.


 



 
In nigh-on half a century of watching football, that's the most extraordinary, staggering, bewildering game I've ever witnessed.


 



 
Seven-one is not a normal result between two world footballing powers. But football can be like that. Sometimes things happen that you don't expect, and that is why it is beautiful.


 



 
It's a humiliating, terrible defeat. I'm holding back because we're suffering with them. Their World Cup is spoilt.


 



 
Master class from Germany. Clinical, organised, hard-working, unselfish and humble. Very proud of the team. One to go.


 



 
I would worry that the Brazilian players might never recover from this. Some might not be able to come back from this.


 



 
A result that leaves us all surprised. Difficult, this moment, for the players and the people of Brazil. The important thing now (is) that peace reigns.


 



 
I know a lot of people thought Germany, but did anyone think it would be like this? Another reason why this has been the best World Cup in history!


 





 
Hats off to (Germany striker) Miroslav Klose! With 16 FIFA World Cup goals, he is the most prolific scorer in the tournament's history.
