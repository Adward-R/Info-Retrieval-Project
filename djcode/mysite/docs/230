Vermaelen returns to Belgium training
Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen is back in contention to feature against Argentina in Saturday's FIFA World Cup™ quarter-final after returning to full training on Thursday. 
The Arsenal centre-back missed his side's last two games due to a right thigh strain, but he was among 13 players who took part in a training session at Belgium's base in Sao Paulo state. 
Another group of players, those who had started Tuesday's 2-1 win over the United States in the last 16, participated in a bike ride. 
Coach Marc Wilmots said that captain Vincent Kompany was "recovering well" from a groin problem that forced him to sit out his side's final group game against Korea Republic a week ago. 
However, midfielder Mousa Dembele is continuing to undergo treatment after receiving a knock against Korea Republic. 
Belgium fly to Brasilia on Thursday evening in preparation for their last-eight encounter against Argentina at the Estadio Nacional on Saturday.
