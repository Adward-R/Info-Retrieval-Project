World Cup squads officially confirmed
The final selections of the 32 coaches at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ have been decided and officially verified, revealing the 736 players who will potentially feature between 12 June - 13 July. 
All the initial provisional squads have been trimmed down, injuries weighed up and fitness assessed as the teams go through their final preparations ahead of the big kick-off in Sao Paulo. From Algeria to USA, the camps are now finalised and all those who have made it in to their team's final 23 can focus on performing well and trying to get on to the pitch during the global finals. 

Big names have been forced to miss out, with the likes of Colombia's Radamel Falcao unfortunately failing to regain fitness and Landon Donovan of the USA not quite making the grade. Even so, there are tons of big names on their way, with nine of Real Madrid's victorious starting line-up from last month's UEFA Champions League final making the trip to Brazil, and many, many more star attractions preparing to line up.
