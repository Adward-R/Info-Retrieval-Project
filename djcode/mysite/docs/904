Braces galore as France hit eight
France finalised their FIFA World Cupâ„¢ preparations with a rampant 8-0 win over Jamaica in Lille.
 
Karim Benzema, Blaise Matuidi and substitute Antoine Griezmann scored two goals apiece, with Yohan Cabaye and Olivier Giroud also on target in a one-sided outing. 
Griezmann's effective 20-minute cameo will have provided encouragement for coach Didier Deschamps, with the Real Sociedad winger likely to be asked to fill the void left by Franck Ribery's withdrawal from the squad to travel to Brazil. 
Mathieu Valbuena and Giroud combined in the 17th minute to set up Cabaye's deftly-taken opener and fellow Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Matuidi netted the second three minutes later after good work by Benzema. 
There was brief concern for Deschamps in the first half when Mathieu Debuchy was left in a heap by a tackle from Kemar Lawrence but the Newcastle United full-back recovered to continue until half-time - by which point France led 3-0 thanks to Benzema. 
Arsenal striker Giroud converted Benzema's cross eight minutes into the second period and 10 minutes later the Real Madrid frontman netted an excellent fifth from outside the box. 
Matuidi also doubled up in the 66th minute, sliding in to meet Patrice Evra's cross with an ungainly but effective finish. 
Griezmann was introduced in place of Giroud in the 71st minute and wasted little time making an impact, finishing from an angle after Valbuena was unable to control Benzema's cross. 
And there was still time for the 23-year-old to provide a fitting flourish when he met another Evra cross with a delicate backheel inside the far post for the eighth goal a minute from time.
