Redknapp: England need own identity
Harry Redknapp wants to see England develop their own brand of football and believes he could offer some guidance if approached by the Football Association. 
There has been a clamour for England to adopt the approach set out by FIFA World Cup™ winners Germany, who drew plenty of plaudits for how they played their football. 
England, meanwhile, exited the tournament bottom of their group with only a point from a goalless draw against Costa Rica. 
Despite many now calling for the nation to copy the German blueprint, the Queens Park Rangers manager wants England to focus on forming their own identity.  
"The problem is, France won the World Cup (in 1998) and we have to copy the French way...and now it is the Germans," said Redknapp. 
Let's be ourselves and get the best out of the players.

"The next World Cup we will be copying someone else wont we, let's be ourselves and get the best out of the players. 
"How do we play the game, what is the England style of play? Everyone should play the same way, under-17s and under-18s, we should be playing in the same way. 
"We should be employing people to work with those kids who have a philosophy of how the game should be played - we have to produce teams that are going to play from the back." 
FA chairman Greg Dyke's review has already suggested several ways in which the governing body hopes to alter the fortunes of the national side and although Redknapp was not included on the panel who drew up the proposals, he reckons he has something to offer. 
When asked if the FA had asked his opinion, the 67-year-old replied: "Of course not, they have too many other experts. If they ask me I would tell them, maybe I can help them."
