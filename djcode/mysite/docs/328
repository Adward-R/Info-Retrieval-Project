Podolski ruled out of Algeria clash
Germany forward Lukas Podolski has been ruled out of Monday's FIFA World Cup™ Round of 16 clash against Algeria in Porto Alegre with a thigh injury. 
The 29-year-old Arsenal star, who is at his third World Cup finals, suffered the injury in Germany's 1-0 win over the USA on Thursday in their final group stage match and an MRI scan on Saturday revealed a small tear. 
"Lukas must rest for two or three days, but should we progress in the tournament it won't be a problem for him to play," said Germany coach Joachim Low. 
With Podolski out, Bayern Munich's Mario Goetze is set to take his place on the left wing. 
Germany's right-back Jerome Boateng also missed training on Saturday with a knee irritation, but Low said it will be "no problem" for the Bayern Munich defender to play.
