Record-breaking downloads for FIFA’s official World Cup app 
The official 2014 FIFA World Cup™ app is now the biggest sports event app, after last night’s Cameroon-Brazil game pushed the total number of downloads to over 18 million for the period 1-23 June.  
FIFA can reveal further details of fan behaviour including the fact that app consumption of official World Cup content has reached 2.5 billion pages less than half way through the tournament, with fans spending an average of 54 minutes each consuming live, editorial and social content within the app.  
The FIFA app is No1 in over 100 countries in the overall download charts and has so far been downloaded more than 22 million times since its launch in December 2013.  
Matt Stone, FIFA Head of Digital commented: “The official FIFA World Cup app has proved to be the most engaging personal technology of the tournament. FIFA's live and social hub, the Global Stadium, has struck a chord with football fans worldwide to #joinin and we are well on course to pass our 2010 FIFA World Cup audience record of 150 million people consuming FIFA content.”
