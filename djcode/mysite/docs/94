Sneijder: We deserved better
The Netherlands' penalty shoot-out loss to Argentina in the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ semi-finals on Wednesday was an unjust way for them to exit the tournament, according to playmaker Wesley Sneijder. 
"We deserve much better," said the Galatasaray midfielder, one of two Dutch players to see a penalty saved by Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero at Sao Paulo's Corinthians Arena. 
"Argentina were playing for penalties, which wasn't the case with us. We tried to play. 
"I missed my penalty. It's a shame. But it's particularly frustrating not to have capitalised on the chances we created over the 120 minutes." 
Argentina won 4-2 on penalties after the contest finished 0-0 following extra time. They will play Germany in the Final on Sunday. 
Dutch centre-back Ron Vlaar saw his opening spot-kick saved by Romero, but having produced a commanding display over the course of the game, he said that he would not let it get him down. 
"It's sport, and it's tough. But I'm a man and I'm not going to whinge about it," he said. 
"Of course, I know that I played well, but positive feelings pass to one side now that I've missed my penalty. 
"We're going home empty-handed. It's sad, because the only thing that counts is the title. There's still the third-place match (against Brazil). But it's not the same thing."
