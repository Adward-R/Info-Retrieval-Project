Quiet night for award chasers
Louis van Gaal deemed the Netherlands' semi-final tussle with Argentina in Sao Paulo was not a night befitting youthful exuberance, as he kept his Hyundai Young Player Award-chasing candidates on the bench. 
Despite scoring twice and making another during four appearances at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, 
 did not make it out onto the field as the clash went to penalties, with the 
 losing 4-2 after a goalless draw.. 
, the Netherlands' other squad member born after the 1 January 1993 cut-off point, was not able to add to his one minute of playing time at the tournament so far. 

The pair will get another shot at proving themselves in a bid to leave Brazil with individual honours, after Argentina ended their hopes of claiming the top prize, when they take on the hosts in the Play-Off for Third Place. Brazil will not have anyone chasing the award when they face off in Brasilia.
