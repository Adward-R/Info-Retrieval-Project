FIFA Fan Fest wins Brazilian hearts
From the special kick-off event on Fortaleza’s Iracema Beach which set the tone for the tournament, through to the post-final fireworks that illuminated the sky above the famous Maracana stadium, the FIFA Fan Fests have been at the heart of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™. 
Incredibly, more than five million people celebrated the tournament at the 12 FIFA Fan Fest locations, proving this remarkable event has been about so much more than just the football. 
Come final day, the extraordinary aerial views of the FIFA Fan Fest on the Copacabana Beach paid testament to the vast swathes of fans, coming together to share the World Cup experience with as many friends as possible. 
In total, 281,716 people attended the FIFA Fan Fest venues to watch Germany take on Argentina, pushing the grand total for the tournament to over five million visitors! 
A perfect solution for fans looking to experience the magic of a World Cup together in a live setting, the FIFA Fan Fest concept has exploded in popularity since being introduced at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™. 
Across the dozen carefully selected iconic Brazilian locations, FIFA Fan Fest arenas have become throbbing hubs of football, music and entertainment – this past month, ensuring secure and family-friendly ‘must-go’ destinations for local and international fans alike. 
In Brazil, an array of special performances by some of the country’s top music acts such as Claudia Leitte, Anita and Monobloco, together with VIP appearances by the likes of FIFA Fan Fest Ambassador Ronaldo, made sure every one of the 64 matches partied after the full time whistle. 
In between matches and live music, revellers enjoyed a selection of international food and drinks, and were keen to get involved in the activities offered onsite by FIFA’s Commercial Affiliates - as well as participate in a little recreational shopping via a wide range of onsite merchandise. 
Already something of a cultural phenomenon in their relatively short history, the FIFA Fan Fest™ in Brazil will go down in history as the month-long beach party to end them all!
