Klose now wants record for himself
Having equalled Ronaldo's record of 15 FIFA World Cupâ„¢ goals on Saturday, Germany striker Miroslav Klose is targeting another addition to his haul to claim the achievement all for himself.
 
The 36-year-old, who is appearing at his fourth edition of the tournament, matched the Brazilian legend during an entertaining 2-2 draw with Ghana in Fortaleza. 
Klose could get his chance to break the record should he play against Jurgen Klinsmann's USA in Recife in their final Group G match on Thursday.  
"I'm itching for it, I want to be the first. That's my big goal," said the Lazio forward. 
Klose produced his trademark somersault celebration after a 70th goal in his 133rd international, but did not have the best of landings. 
He admitted it was the first time he had attempted the extravagant acrobatics for a while after an injury-hit season in Serie A. 
"At my age, I didn't want to keep doing those anymore," he said. "The fact I didn't quite pull it off so well doesn't matter, but you could see I was out of practice for it."
