Low: We can write history
Joachim Low wants Germany to make history in the Maracana on Sunday and then dominate world football for many years to come. After their 7-1 victory against Brazil in the semi-final, Germany are favourites to beat Argentina and win the FIFA World Cup™ in Rio de Janeiro. 
If Germany are successful, it will be the fourth time they have won the famous trophy, but it will be the only occasion they have triumphed on South American soil. 
No European nation has won the tournament on this continent in four attempts. Czechoslovakia and Holland reached the final in 1962 and 1978 respectively, but Low hopes his team can go one better in Brazil this weekend. 
"In the past we never had this, so we know we can write history," the Germany coach told a press conference on the eve of the final. 
"Latin Americans, on this continent, have dominated all the time. So why can we not be the first? This could be considered an additional joy for us if we were to win as Europeans on Latin American soil."
