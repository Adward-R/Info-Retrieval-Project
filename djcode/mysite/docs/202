Messi's special message to injured Neymar
Lionel Messi has wished Barcelona team-mate Neymar a quick recovery after the Brazil star suffered a fractured vertebra on Friday, ruling him out of the remainder of the FIFA World Cupâ„¢.
 
"Neymar, I hope that you recover very quickly," wrote the Argentinian on his Facebook page alongside a photgraph of the two stars in their Barcelona shirts. 
Messi, who like Neymar has been the stand-out star for his team, will hope to join Brazil in the semi-finals later on Saturday when he leads his Argentinian team-mates against Belgium in Brasilia.
