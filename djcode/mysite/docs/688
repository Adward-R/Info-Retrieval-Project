Hummels confident of injury recovery
Germany defender Mats Hummels does not believe his 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazilâ„¢ is over, despite limping out of Monday's 4-0 win over Portugal in clear pain. The Borussia Dortmund defender will undergo tests on later today to discover the entity of a thigh injury which saw him replaced by Sampdoria's Shkodran Mustafi during the comfortable win. 
Hummels scored Germany's second goal in the rout and expects to have the chance to contribute further as the tournament progresses. "The injury doesn't feel like something which would end my World Cup," Hummels told 
television. "Maybe it will cost me one game, or maybe none at all. It looked worse than it is. I do have my thigh heavily wrapped, but it's going to be fine. It could have been worse." 
The expression of Germany's doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt was not so optimistic as he helped Hummels leave the field hopping on one leg, however. He will perform a scan, with Germany coach Joachim Low not sounding too anxious about the results. "He's just taken a knock to the thigh," Low told 
television. "I don't expect it to be anything dramatic." 
The injury was the only concern on an otherwise emphatic evening for one of the World Cup favourites, who underlined their credentials thanks to a hat-trick from Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller, who last week penned a new five-year contract with his club.
