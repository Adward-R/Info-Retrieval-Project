Argentina FA fined for breaching FIFA World Cup regulations
The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has imposed a fine of CHF 300,000 and pronounced a reprimand against the Argentina FA in relation to breaches of the Regulations 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ and the competition’s Media & Marketing Regulations. 
Disciplinary proceedings were opened after Argentina turned up to three consecutive Match Day -1 press conferences in the stadium (ARG v. NIG, ARG v. SUI, ARG v. BEL), with only the head coach present instead of the required head coach plus at least one player. The same incident occurred at the Match Day -1 press conference prior to the semi-final ARG v. NED. 
After analysing all necessary elements, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee found the Argentina FA guilty of breaching art. 4 par. 1 lit. f and 4. par. 2 of the Regulations 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil as well as art. 12.2 2
 part (i) of the competition’s Media & Marketing Regulations. 
The objective of the said regulations is 
 to allow media, and ultimately fans, to have an opportunity to follow a team’s preparations, while also allowing each team to have the best possible environment for those preparations.
