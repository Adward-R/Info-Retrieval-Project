Cavani sets up Uruguay win
Uruguay completed their preparation for the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ by winning 2-0 at home against Slovenia in Montevideo. 
With Luis Suarez still sidelined by a knee injury, it fell to Edinson Cavani and Christian Stuani to provide the goals at the Centenario stadium. 
Cavani headed the first from 10 yards in the 37th minute when he powerfully met a floated cross from the left delivered by Diego Forlan.  
Paris St Germain striker Cavani was involved in the second goal in the 76th minute too, when he took the ball away from Slovenia goalkeeper Samir Handanovic and handed Stuani an easy task of slotting in. 
Uruguay line up with England, Italy and Costa Rica in Group D at the World Cup in Brazil. They start against Costa Rica on 14 June.
