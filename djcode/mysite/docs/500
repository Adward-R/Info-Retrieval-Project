Costa Rica to make changes against England
Costa Rica may need just a point against England on Tuesday to secure top spot in Group D but coach Jorge Luis Pinto will still ring the changes, assistant boss Paulo Wanchope said on Sunday. Costa Rica have been one of the major surprises at the FIFA World Cup™ so far, beating both Uruguay and Italy to secure their passage to the Round of 16 before facing England. 
If they avoid defeat they will be assured of topping the group but Costa Rica will have one eye on the knock-out rounds and Wanchope, who scored in both the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, says they will give some fringe players a chance. 
"The first thing is to manage our emotions. We've already qualified but it is important to look forward, it's important to keep growing as a team," said the 37-year-old former Derby County, West Ham United and Manchester City forward. 
Wanchope said there would be changes to "give some other players some football. It's important to give some football to those who don't normally get any and also to see how they fit into the system." 
While it is always considered advantageous to win your group, Costa Rica full-back Christian Gamboa said his side wouldn't see it as a disadvantage to come second as they would likely face Colombia in the Round of 16. 
"If we get Colombia, the professor (Pinto) knows them really well, he knows everything about his country and so we could have something of an advantage," said Gamboa.
