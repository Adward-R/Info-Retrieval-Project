Kompany, Vermaelen out for Korea game
Belgium captain Vincent Kompany and fellow English Premier League star Thomas Vermaelen will miss Thursday's FIFA World Cupâ„¢ Group H game against Korea Republic with minor injuries, their coach said. 
Marc Wilmots said Manchester City's Kompany trained for just 35 minutes on Wednesday, ahead of the Korea game in Sao Paulo, after a recurrence of a groin problem. 
He did not give details of the injury affecting Vermaelen, but the Arsenal defender lasted just 31 minutes of the 1-0 win over Russia before coming off with a knee problem. 
"They're not very serious but we want to keep them fresh. They won't play against South Korea," Wilmots told reporters in Sao Paulo. 
Belgium have qualified for the round of 16 by winning their opening two group games.
