Chile hoping for Vidal return
Chile are hoping star midfielder Arturo Vidal is fit and able to face Australia in Cuiaba on Friday. The Juventus player has been struggling with inflammation in his right knee following an operation on his meniscus last month and has had a big question mark over his availability to play in the FIFA World Cup™ ever since. 
Vidal, a free-kick specialist, has trained with the team since Wednesday and featured for 15 minutes in a 2-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland last week. 
"Arturo trained like the rest of us," said Chile midfielder Gary Medel. "He did a good job and didn't have any pain in his knee. We hope that he can be with us for the first game. It will depend on him and how he feels." 
We have worked really hard to be here.

Medel added: "We want him to take care of himself and if he does play, we hope it (meniscus) doesn't affect him." 
Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli will have two big tests coming up with reigning World Cup champions Spain and Netherlands also in the pool. Medel, who was Cardiff City's record signing when he joined them last summer, says there is a good atmosphere in the squad. 
He said: "We want to go as far as possible. We want to make history with this group. We hope to go all the way. We have a great generation of players and we have worked really hard to be here. 
"We hope that people enjoy our play and above all, we want to be champions."
