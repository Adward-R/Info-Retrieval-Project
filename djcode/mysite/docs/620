Oxlade-Chamberlain ruled out of Uruguay contest
Roy Hodgson will not be risking Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for England's FIFA World Cupâ„¢ clash with Uruguay. The 20-year-old midfielder has been absent since straining a medial ligament in his right knee during the 2-2 friendly draw against Ecuador on June 4. 
Oxlade-Chamberlain is making steady progress in his rehabilitation and Hodgson had initially hoped he would be fit to face Uruguay. However, the Three Lions boss will not be risking the Arsenal midfielder at the Arena Corinthians on Thursday, despite the importance of winning the Group D encounter. 
"He is not in contention for tomorrow, but he will take part in the next four training sessions," Hodgson said of his only injury concern. "Today was his last training session as, if you like, an individual. 
"At the minute, we could have taken a chance with him tomorrow, but it would be much better if he uses the four days after this game and before the Costa Rica game to train with the team. Fortunately for us, his actual injury has responded really well to treatment but I don't think we will put him into the firing line tomorrow before he has had some training sessions with the team."
