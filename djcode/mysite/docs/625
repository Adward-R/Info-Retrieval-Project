Mourinho: Muller not tested yet
Jose Mourinho does not share the hype surrounding Germany goal-scoring sensation Thomas Muller, saying he would like to see him score a hat-trick against a strong defence and not the perforated Portugal back-line he met on Monday. 
Muller, top-scorer at the FIFA World Cup™ four years ago, already tops the charts in Brazil after just one game. His hat-trick against Portugal took him to eight goals in seven World Cup finals' appearances, but that has not particularly impressed the Chelsea coach. 
"I would like to see Muller up against a compact defence," he told Yahoo Eurosport. "That would test him. Portugal were far too weak. There are plenty of teams at this World Cup who defend far better, are much tighter and better organised." 
Mourinho nevertheless found some praise for the Bayern Munich midfielder-cum-forward, who netted 13 times in the Bundesliga last season. "He's incredibly dynamic and has a unique goalscoring instinct, and he finds room on the field that nobody else knows about. But I still think that, even with Muller, Germany don't have a real forward in their team."
