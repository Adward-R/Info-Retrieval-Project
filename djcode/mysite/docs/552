Official statement following meeting on FIFA World Cup security 
Representatives from the Ministry of Justice, Abin (Brazilian Intelligence Agency), the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Sport, FIFA and the LOC met on Friday in Rio de Janeiro to evaluate the security operations after the first week of the FIFA World Cup™.  
During the meeting, all parties reaffirmed the integrated security concept and made a detailed analysis of the operations at the stadia. As a result of this evaluation, it was decided to reinforce security in the stadia perimeters (both physically and with personnel) and to increase the presence of public security on access control points (mag & bags) as well as private security (stewards) inside the 12 stadiums.
