Dwight Yorke supports Anti-Discrimination Days
On 4 and 5 July, at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ quarter-finals, the football community will be celebrating the 13
 annual Anti-Discrimination Day. Dwight Yorke, former captain of the Trinidad-and-Tobago national team and former striker for Manchester United, gave an interview to 
 in which he explains that “trying to eradicate discrimination of the game through football, which is a global sport, is the right direction to take”.   
Since 2002, FIFA’s Anti-Discrimination Days have taken place every year during at least one of FIFA’s competitions with a special pre-match protocol, at which the team captains read a short declaration against discrimination. 
The captains’ message reads as follow: “We wholeheartedly reject discrimination on any grounds, including race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, and religion. Using the power of football, we can help to eradicate racism and discrimination from our sport and society at large. We pledge to pursue this goal and urge you to join us in this fight.” 
Yorke considers that it is the role of the players to “set the right example, on and off the field of play”. FIFA and the Local Organising Committee encourage all players, coaches, officials and fans throughout the world to say no to discrimination in all its forms. 
This year, the campaign is complemented by a #SayNoToRacism “selfie” campaign on social media platforms, in which over 500,000 people participated. A random selection of these will be shown before the quarter-finals kick off on the giant screens in the stadiums (Estadio Nacional, Arena Fonte Nova, Estadio Castelao and Estadio do Maracana).
