FIFA World Cup to tackle discrimination, promote gender equality & peace
As millions of fans get set to tune in to Thursday's opening match, we call on the football community, governments and the civic society to reaffirm the importance of tackling racism and discrimination and of promoting gender equality and peace during the events of the FIFA World Cup™ and beyond.  
The following message will be communicated in the stadium ahead of each of the 64 FIFA World Cup matches:  
“Today we strive not only for victory in the game, but for the victory of peace; for mutual respect, regardless of gender, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion or class. These are the values and aspirations of FIFA, the wider world of sport and people everywhere. We pledge to do our utmost to achieve global peace and a life of dignity for all.”
