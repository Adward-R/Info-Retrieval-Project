Brazil warm up with friendly win
Brazil started their preparations for Tuesday's FIFA World Cup clash with Mexico by beating the U-20 side of Rio de Janeiro club Fluminense in a friendly on Saturday morning. 
The game, at the Selecao's training base in Teresopolis, ended in a 3-0 win for the World Cup hosts, with Ramires, Hernanes and Willian finding the net. Of the team that started in Thursday's 3-1 Group A win against Croatia in Sao Paulo, only midfielder Paulinho featured in the line-up this time, and he was eventually replaced by diminutive winger Bernard. 
The game was the chance for the back-up players to impress, and Chelsea midfielder Ramires in particular stood out, but Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari is unlikely to make many changes to a winning team against Mexico at the Castelao Stadium in northern city Fortaleza. 
Mexico began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory against Cameroon in Natal on Friday.
