Klinsmann: I have nothing to prove
United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann has insisted he has nothing to prove when he faces his homeland Germany in their final FIFA World Cup™ Group G match in Recife on Thursday. 
Klinsmann led Germany to the semi-finals at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany, as well as a season with Bayern Munich, which included some of the current German squad. 
However, he said it was more important for the development of US soccer to get the point they need to qualify for the Round of 16 than for him to prove a point against some of his former charges. 
"We are going to approach it with a lot of determination and in a very focused way, we want to be very aggressive and we want to give Germany a real battle," he said on Wednesday. 
"I, personally, have nothing to prove. I enjoy my work with the United States tremendously, I enjoyed my job with Germany and I also enjoyed my year with Bayern Munich, which was a very turbulent year but that is just part of the job. 
"I am looking forward to tomorrow, my family will be a little bit split but that is just part of it. At the end of the day it is a beautiful game of football and I hope everyone will enjoy it."
