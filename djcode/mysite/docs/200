Cafu: Follow the numbers
Few people know the FIFA World Cup™ stage as well as Cafu, with the legendary Brazilian right-back reaching the Final on no less than three occasions (1994, 1998 and 2002), claiming the coveted Trophy twice.
 
As he told 
, “hard work and dedication” are the keys to such an exalted level of success, while he considers himself to be “a special case and blessed”. The Castrol Ambassador is therefore well-placed to give advice to those competing in Castrol's FIFA World Cup Predictor Challenge for Brazil 2014. 
In total, more than 400,000 fans have been predicting, on a daily basis, every aspect of the competition’s 64 games. Now there are just six matches remaining, is it time for a change in strategy? 
“Of course,” said Cafu. “By the time you get into the latter stages you know the teams and their opponents well, which makes predicting a little easier. Before it was important to go over their backgrounds and investigate a little more,” he added from Fortaleza, still clearly buzzing after witnessing Luiz Felipe Scolari’s Brazil reach the semi-finals. 
Without wanting to hold him up for too long, such is his wealth of experience that not asking this final question would be remiss: what would he say to those who have battled all tournament long and are aiming for glory in the finishing straight? “Take my advice and use the statistics. That’ll be the key: follow the numbers.”
