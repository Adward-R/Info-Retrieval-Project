Gerrard to consider England future
England captain Steven Gerrard admitted on Sunday that he is considering his options following his side's FIFA World Cup™ exit, but denied reports he is poised to announce his international retirement. 
"There's no truth that I'll be making any announcement within the next week," the 34-year-old told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, two days after England's group-phase elimination was confirmed. 
"I spoke to the manager [Roy Hodgson] to ask for some time to think about my [international] future. I will not be rushing into a decision." 
He added: "I am still hurting very bad. I'm broken from what's gone on over the last couple of weeks. I need to clear my head before I make that big decision." 
Gerrard, who made his England debut in 2000, stands to win his 114th cap against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, one less than the record for an outfield player set by David Beckham.
