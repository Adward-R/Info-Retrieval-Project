Scolari sends message to beaten Portugal
Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari took time out from preparing for his side's FIFA World Cupâ„¢ meeting with Mexico by urging his former team, Portugal, to keep their chins up after a thrashing by Germany.
 
Scolari led Portugal to the final of UEFA EURO 2004 as well as the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup in 2006, and he admitted he felt for them after their 4-0 defeat in Salvador earlier today. 
"I should like to remind Portugal and my Portuguese friends that at EURO 2004, when I was coach, we lost our opening group game and then won the others to qualify for the second phase," he said. 
After their thumping by the Germans, Cristiano Ronaldo and Co have to try to rescue their campaign with further Group G games against USA in Manaus and then Ghana in Brasilia. 
"Portugal must put this defeat behind them and get a win in their next game and then win again in the third game to go through," added Scolari. "Portugal have the team to come through."
