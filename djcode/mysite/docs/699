Del Bosque retains sense of optimism
Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has revealed that his players have come to terms with their defeat by the Netherlands in their opening FIFA World Cup™ game and are ready to bounce back against Chile.
 
The 5-1 thumping the reigning world and European champions received at the hands of the Dutch, who they defeated in the last FIFA World Cup Final, was the shock of the tournament so far. 
Del Bosque said after the game that the result was "unexplainable" while midfielder Xavi Hernandez said it was the worst defeat of his entire career. 
However, the 
 coach has explained that time has been a healer for his side, who are now desperate to compensate for the loss by beating Chile and then Australia in their remaining Group B matches. 
"Everyone feels that we are capable of turning things around," the coach told Spanish television channel 
. 
"Many hours have passed and our spirits are higher. We now have to win our next two games, which won't be easy, but is within the realms of possibility. We are searching for the best possible preparation and we are trying to make sure the players are not sad, we have to enjoy ourselves." 
Del Bosque also insisted he did not see the result against the Netherlands coming, explaining that the team had prepared well for the tournament and made a positive start to the game. 
"We've been training well ever since we arrived. Everything has been perfect, and the first half against Holland went well. What was worrying was the second half. But now the players are optimistic again."
