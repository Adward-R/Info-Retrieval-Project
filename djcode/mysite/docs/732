Lugano: Our task is not impossible
Uruguay captain Diego Lugano cut an upbeat figure today despite his team's shock 3-1 defeat by Costa Rica at the FIFA World Cup™. 
The 33-year-old admitted his side have their backs to the wall but said qualification for the knockout stages is not beyond their capabilities. 
The defeat by Group D rivals Costa Rica, coupled with England's 2-1 reverse against Italy, means Thursday's clash in Sao Paulo between the two pointless sides is one neither can afford to lose. 
"If it was difficult before, now it's much more difficult, but not impossible. It will depend on what we can overcome," the West Bromwich Albion defender commented on Twitter about Uruguay's qualification hopes. 
"What happened is within the realm of probability. Costa Rica deserved it and we made mistakes. There is a lot we can correct and improve on." 
Looking forward to their next match, Lugano said 
 would never give up. "Now what we have to do is get back up and keep fighting," he added.
