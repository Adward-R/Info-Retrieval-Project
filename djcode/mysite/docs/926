Ronaldo returns to training
Cristiano Ronaldo has given Portugal a boost on the eve of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazilâ„¢ by resuming training. 
There were concerns the Real Madrid player may miss the opening Group G game against Germany because of knee and thigh problems. 
However, the Portuguese Football Association gave an encouraging update on Saturday, nine days before the opener in Salvador. 
The FPF statement read: "Cristiano Ronaldo and Raul Meireles integrated with the remaining group of players." 
Midfielder Meireles had been struggling with a muscular problem. However, central defender Pepe worked away from the main group of players as he continued his recovery from a leg injury. 
The statement added: "Pepe is carrying out his rehabilitation and sport specific exercises in the field individually."
