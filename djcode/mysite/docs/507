Boateng, Khedira carrying slight knocks
Jerome Boateng and defensive midfielder Sami Khedira are both nursing knocks ahead of Germany's final FIFA World Cupâ„¢ group match against USA on Thursday.
 
Boateng suffered a strain in his left thigh and failed to come out for the second half of their 2-2 draw with Ghana on Saturday in Group G. 
Khedira strained a ligament in his left knee in the draw and the pair were both treated at Germany's FIFA World Cup base today and missed training.  
Team manager Oliver Bierhoff said Khedira should be fit to face former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann's Stars and Stripes in Recife and it is hoped the pair will be able to train on Monday. 
Thomas Muller, who scored a hat-trick in their opening 4-0 win against Portugal, will be fit despite needing stitches in a head wound after crashing into the shoulder of Ghana defender John Boye in the final stages.
