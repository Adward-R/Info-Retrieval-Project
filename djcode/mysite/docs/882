Memorable Opening Match goals
relives the first goals scored at FIFA World Cups™ over recent decades dating back to Erwin Vandenbergh’s shock winner over holders Argentina in 1982.  
More recently Siphiwe Tshabalala’s remarkable strike for South Africa four years ago set the Rainbow Nation alight, a feat Neymar and Co will be aiming to reproduce in Sao Paulo as Brazil 2014 kicks-off.  
The Opening Match has a habit of producing both memorable moments and upset results, highlighted by Francois Omam-Biyik’s astonishing header as Cameroon stunned Argentina in 1990, and Papa Bouba Diop’s winner for Senegal against France 12 years later.
