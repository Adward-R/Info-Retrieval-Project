Gonzalez clear for Costa Rica 
Costa Rica defender Giancarlo Gonzalez will not miss the first three games of his country's FIFA World Cup™ campaign after being sent off for violent conduct. 
The 26-year-old defender was dismissed 41 minutes into the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland in Philadelphia during the early hours of Saturday morning for swinging an elbow at striker Kevin Doyle. 
However under FIFA rules, the repercussions of his red card will not come into force until Costa Rica's next friendly, meaning he is free to play in Brazil. The regulations state in relation to the sending off: "Friendly matches: (suspension) carried over to the representative team's next friendly match." 
Gonzalez was reprimanded by manager Jorge Luis Pinto and told to learn his lesson in the immediate aftermath of the game at PPL Park. 
The game was Costa Rica's last before they open their campaign against Uruguay in Fortaleza on 14 June before meeting remaining Group D rivals Italy and England.
