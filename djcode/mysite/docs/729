Oxlade-Chamberlain steps up rehab
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain trained alongside his England team-mates on Monday, although the heavy strapping on his knee suggested a return for the do-or-die FIFA World Cupâ„¢ clash with Uruguay is far from certain. 
The 20-year-old midfielder missed the Three Lions' 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus on Saturday through injury. Oxlade-Chamberlain strained a medial ligament in his right knee during England's 2-2 friendly draw against Ecuador on 4 June, but his rehabilitation from the problem sustained in Miami is going well. 
Having began sprinting again last week, the Arsenal man joined in with his team-mates on Monday at England's Urca military base. Oxlade-Chamberlain was the last player out on the field in the Rio de Janeiro sunshine and was quickly involved in ball work, albeit a simple dribbling drill. 
His right knee was heavily-strapped and, after 10 minutes of the part-open session, went off to do individual work with physio Steve Kemp. Oxlade-Chamberlain did some passing drills with him, showing no discomfort; an encouraging sign but one which does not necessarily mean Roy Hodgson will have a full complement of players to choose from against Uruguay. 
While his side impressed many with their performance against Italy, defeat in Sao Paulo would all-but end hopes of progressing to the knock-out stages. Uruguay are in the same position after suffering a shock 3-1 defeat in their opener to Costa Rica.
