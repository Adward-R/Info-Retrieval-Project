Reus facing three months out
Marco Reus faces a longer-than-expected three months out after picking up a foot injury in Germany's 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazilâ„¢ warm-up match against Armenia on Friday. 
The Borussia Dortmund midfielder was carried off the field in tears and was officially ruled out of the Brazil showpiece on Saturday after early scans confirmed a partial ligament tear in his left ankle. 
It was hoped that he would be able to return in time for the start of the new Bundesliga season in August, but further tests at Dortmund's Knappschafts hospital with club doctor Markus Braun have ruled that out.  
"The tests revealed that, in addition to his ankle injury, Reus also suffered damage to the heel bone with an expected recovery time of about three months," the club said on their official website.
