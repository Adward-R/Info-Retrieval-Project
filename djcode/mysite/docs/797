Carvalho: Ronaldo is '100 per cent' fit
Cristiano Ronaldo is fit and ready for Portugal's opening FIFA World Cup™ match against Germany according to teammate William Carvalho. The Real Madrid star had ice applied to his left knee after training on Thursday, sparking fears over his fitness ahead of Monday's Group G opener. 
"I think he's now 100 per cent fit," said Carvalho on Friday at Portugal's training base in Campinas, outside Sao Paulo. 
Portugal captain Ronaldo featured in a 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland in the United States earlier this week before being substituted. He had missed his country's previous two warm-up games because of thigh and knee injuries. 
"Regarding his physical fitness, that's more for the doctors and physios to reply but of course he's a very important player for us, the best in the world," Carvalho said.
