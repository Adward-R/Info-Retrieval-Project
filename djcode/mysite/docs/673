Muller: No thoughts of Golden Boot
Thomas Muller insists he has not thought about winning the Golden Boot for a second successive FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil. 
The Germany forward's hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Portugal in Salvador propelled him to the top of the scoring charts for this tournament but the Bayern Munich star said he is not focusing on personal records. Muller, who scored five goals in South Africa to finish as joint top scorer, said: "Let's remain objective here, this was just the first match. 
"We just want to be world champions and if we do that, records may or may not come, but we have other things to focus on. A hat-trick at the World Cup doesn't happen every day of course, but I have had a good run at World Cups and I wanted to pick up where I left off. I am known for giving my utmost, but no one could have assumed that would happen and I can't say that will happen again in the next match, but I'll certainly try."

Meanwhile, Germany defender Mats Hummels does not believe his FIFA World Cup is over despite limping out of Monday's win in obvious pain. The Borussia Dortmund defender will have tests to discover the extent of a thigh injury which saw him replaced by Sampdoria's Shkodran Mustafi. 
Hummels, who scored Germany's second goal with a bullet header, told 
 television: "The injury doesn't feel like something which would end my World Cup. Maybe it will cost me one game, or maybe none at all It looked worse than it is. I do have my thigh heavily strapped, but it's going to be fine. It could have been worse." 
Germany coach Joachim Löw confirmed that he is not too anxious about the injury. "He's just taken a knock to the thigh," Löw said. "I don't expect it to be anything dramatic."
