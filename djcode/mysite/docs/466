Youngsters Barkley, Shaw to start for England
England manager Roy Hodgson will make nine changes for his side's final 2014 FIFA World Cupâ„¢ game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, he said. Defender Gary Cahill and striker Daniel Sturridge will be the only survivors from Thursday's 2-1 loss to Uruguay in Sao Paulo, which sealed England's elimination in the group phase. 
Ben Foster will play in goal, with Phil Jones, Cahill, Chris Smalling, and teenager Luke Shaw in defence, Hodgson told a press conference at the Estadio Mineirao. The midfield will be made up of James Milner, Frank Lampard, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana, with Sturridge up front, he added. 
Southampton left-back Shaw, 18, and 20-year-old Everton midfielder Barkley will be making their first competitive starts for England. While Hodgson is eager to give as many members of his squad a taste of World Cup football as possible, he also wants to see his side sign off with a victory. 
"With a very different team and a lot of players who haven't played in the tournament so far, I wanted everyone to go home from this tournament - or at least as many as possible - having taken part and played in a game, not just training," he said. "We're very conscious of the fact that our fans are as disappointed and devastated as we are, but they are still here supporting us. 
"We came into the hotel and received a lot of sympathy, kind words from them, and we really want to make certain tomorrow [Tuesday] night that they see something that they can take some encouragement from. And most importantly of all, it's a top-class international on the biggest stage of all, the World Cup, so anything else than taking the game very seriously and trying to win the game in its own right would be out of the question."
