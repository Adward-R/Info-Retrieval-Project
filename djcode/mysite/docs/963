Here on 
 we have a video stockpile of some of this year’s nominees (click on the links to the right and top) that display the qualities and strengths of these eager debutants.

Who will join the likes of previous winners Lukas Podolski (Germany 2006) and Thomas Muller (South Africa 2010) on the podium? Will it be Belgium’s powerful Romelu Lukaku, or his Red Devil teammate Adnan Januzaj. Will England pairing Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley show their ability and style? Maybe France’s Paul Pogba or tricky Andy Najar of Honduras?  
It is an impossible question to answer, but what fun to track their progress over the next month in Brazil. Get your head-start here with our video highlights!
