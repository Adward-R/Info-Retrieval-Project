Ronaldo: I'm fit and ready
Cristiano Ronaldo insists he is '100 percent fit' and ready to feature for Portugal in their opening FIFA World Cup™ fixture against Germany on Monday. The 29-year-old FIFA Ballon d'Or winner has suffered with a knee and thigh problem recently, but played a full part in Sunday's final training session in Salvador. 
"I have been practising for a few days, which I couldn't do if I was injured," said Ronaldo ahead of the Group G clash. "I'd like to be 110 percent, but I am at 100 percent and ready to help the national team. 
"Obviously, I would like to play without pain, but in my entire career I have always had injuries and knocks to deal with, but I am ready to play." 
The Arena Fonte Nova clash is a re-run of Portugal's Euro 2012 opener against Germany, where they lost 1-0, while the Germans have beaten the Portuguese at three of the last four major tournaments. 
"Obviously the historical record has been positive for Germany recently, but I remember a recent case when Real Madrid couldn't beat Bayern Munich and that changed," said Ronaldo, whose Real side beat Bayern in this season's UEFA Champions League semi-final. 
"I hope this is the year Portugal change things against Germany and maybe tomorrow is when that will happen."
