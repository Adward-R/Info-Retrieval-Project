Brazil legend Zagallo released from hospital
Mario Zagallo, 82, has been released from hospital in Rio, where he had been having tests for a spinal infection, his son revealed.  
Zagallo, a world champion as a player in 1958 and 1962, then again as coach in 1970 and once more in 1994 as assistant coach, has been suffering from the ailment for three weeks and had spent 11 days having tests. 
"He is at home and in principle will go to see (FIFA World Cup) matches at the Maracana," said his son, Mario Zagallo Jr, who is a doctor. "I am with him at home, and we are continuing the treatment."Â
