Closing ceremony to celebrate Brazil 2014 in style
Before the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ Final gets underway at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, a special closing ceremony involving around 1,000 people will celebrate the greatest values of the globe’s most popular sport as the tournament nears its unmissable climax. 
European heavyweights Germany meet South American contenders Argentina in the showpiece fixture of the competition in Brazil, but before the football kicks off and the champions are decided, an 18-minute show inside the stadium will pay tribute to the game and its key symbols. 
Beginning with an on-pitch expression of the sport’s values through four characters – Freedom, Solidarity, Passion and Diversity – the ceremony will subsequently include representations of all 32 teams to have participated at this World Cup, with particular focus on the two finalists: Joachim Low’s 
and Alejandro Sabella’s 
. 
Set to a soundtrack of samba music, incorporating a cast of 400 people and featuring GRES Academicos do Grande Rio, a special reference to the sought-after Trophy also takes centre stage, while a unique tribute to football symbolically brings together the two sides battling to be crowned winners when the full-time whistle is blown in Rio. 
The Brazil 2014 closing ceremony will conclude with a spectacular combination of music: Shakira and Carlinhos Brown perform “Dare”; Alexandre Pires, Carlos Santana and Wyclef Jean provide a rendition of the World Cup official anthem, “We Will Find A Way”; plus, a medley of Brazilian songs courtesy of Pires and Ivete Sangalo.
