Di Maria to miss semi-final
Angel Di Maria will miss Argentina's FIFA World Cupâ„¢ semi-final against the Netherlands on Wednesday. 
The Argentinian Football Federation announced the Real Madrid winger would not be fit enough to feature after suffering a thigh injury in the 1-0 quarter-final victory over Belgium. 
The federation said in a statement on their official website that Di Maria underwent tests over the weekend which determined he would not be available to face the Dutch. His condition will continue to be evaluated day by day. 
Di Maria scored the extra-time winner which knocked out Switzerland in the last 16.
