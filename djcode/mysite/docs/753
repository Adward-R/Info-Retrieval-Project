Hulk hopeful on fitness for Mexico
Brazil forward Hulk is hopeful of being fit for Tuesday's FIFA World Cup™ Group A match against Mexico after pulling out of training with a muscle problem. 
The 27-year-old Zenit St Petersburg player immediately left the field after scoring in a training game between the likely starting line-up for the match against Mexico and the substitutes. 
Hulk, whose place was taken by Ramires, appeared to be suffering from a hamstring problem but he later spoke to media in Teresopolis to confirm that he would travel with the rest of the Brazil squad for the upcoming game at the Estadio Castelao in northern city Fortaleza. 
"I felt a pain in my left hamstring. It has been there for a few days but it did not stop me from playing in the first game [against Croatia] and God willing it will not stop me from playing in the next match," Hulk said. 
"I hope to be 100 per cent ready in two days' time." 
Depending on the condition of Hulk, the indications are that coach Luiz Felipe Scolari will look to field the same team against Mexico as that which beat Croatia 3-1 in Sao Paulo on Thursday. 
The Brazil squad were due to fly north later on Sunday before training at the Castelao on Monday afternoon.
