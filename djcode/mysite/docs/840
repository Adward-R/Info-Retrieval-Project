Scolari hails goalscorer Oscar
Neymar stole the show for Brazil in their opening FIFA World Cupâ„¢ triumph over Croatia, but coach Luiz Felipe Scolari hailed the impact of Chelsea midfielder Oscar. 
Brazil won 3-1 with Neymar scoring twice - the 22-year-old's 32nd and 33rd goals for his country in only 50 caps - with Oscar getting the third after Croatia had taken an early lead through Marcelo's own goal. 
There have been doubts expressed in the Brazilian media about 22-year-old Oscar's form, but Scolari insisted he had never lost faith. 
Scolari, who guided Brazil to be world champions in 2002 and has never lost a World Cup match with the country, said: "Neymar got man of the match, but if there was a second award it should go to Oscar. 
He was fantastic and that's the kind of player he is and I have always believed in him.

"Our statistics after the game shows he was the one who made the most tackles, and made lots of dribbles and crosses - he was our most creative player on the right. 
"He was fantastic and that's the kind of player he is and I have always believed in him. Any doubts came from your side [the media]. His level may have dropped but I never lost belief in him." 
Neymar admitted he had had a dream start to the World Cup. The Barcelona forward said: "I think I am happier than I ever dreamt, to start with a victory in the World Cup such as this. 
"The whole team deserves praise for being able to keep calm and turn things around."
