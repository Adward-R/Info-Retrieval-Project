Belgium given Lukaku boost
Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku has trained for the first time in Brazil after suffering an injury scare and gave the team a boost by coming through unscathed. 
Lukaku, who spent a productive campaign on loan at Everton from Chelsea last season, picked up an ankle injury in a physical friendly against Tunisia on Saturday. 
"I have my 23 players available and we are delighted to be in Brazil after three weeks of preparation," said Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, who earlier signed a new deal to remain as coach until 2018. 
Belgium are in Group H at the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ and start their campaign against Algeria on 17 June at Belo Horizonte before facing Russia and Korea Republic. 
An agreement between Wilmots, who has been in charge since 2012, and the Belgian federation had been reached in April but he was waiting for his backroom staff to sign before he committed himself to an updated contract.
