Ribery: I'm happy for my team-mates
France winger Franck Ribery, who missed the FIFA World Cup™ through injury, returned to training with Bayern Munich on Tuesday and paid tribute to his German team-mates crowned world champions in Brazil.  
"I feel good and I'm pleased to be here again," Ribery said in a statement on the Bundesliga champions' website. 
The 31-year-old was ruled out of the finals in Brazil with a lower back problem but was back in training on Tuesday as he was put through his paces on an individually-tailored programme. He is expected to rejoin full team training sessions soon. 
Ribery was also full of praise for Germany's World Cup-winning squad, which featured seven Bayern players, saying he was "so, so happy for my team-mates and for the whole German team". 
The freshly crowned world champions were greeted by more than 250,000 jubilant fans in Berlin on Tuesday upon returning home from Rio de Janeiro. 
"The moment when (Germany captain) Philipp (Lahm) lifted the trophy was super," added Ribery.
