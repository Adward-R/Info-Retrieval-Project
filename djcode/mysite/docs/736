Leckie: We can beat Netherlands
Mathew Leckie believes that Australia can record a win over the Netherlands following their emphatic 5-1 victory against reigning FIFA World Cup™ champions Spain.  
The Socceroos lost 3-1 in their opening game to Chile, but winger Leckie, one of their stand-out performers, was unfazed by the prospect of facing the Dutch. 
"We really want to get a result so we're going to try and find the areas where we can hurt the Dutch team," said Leckie, ahead of Wednesday's Group B game in Porto Alegre. "I think if we can play as well as we did that 70 minutes we'll definitely have an opportunity to get a win." 
While Australia lost in Cuiaba, in Salvador the Netherlands handed out the worst ever World Cup defeat of any reigning champions. However, Leckie feels Australia's inexperienced line-up could spring a few surprises on the 2010 World Cup runners-up. 
I think if we can play as well as we did that 70 minutes we'll definitely have an opportunity to get a win.
Matthew Leckie on facing Netherlands
He said: "I'm sure Chile didn't expect such a hard game as what they got and Holland, obviously they've now seen that game and they'll probably review it as well. But we'll definitely hit them in areas they won't expect and hopefully we can be clinical in the opportunities that we get and we can put a few goals away." 
"We'll go out there with our game plan and hopefully we can play as well as we did for that 70 minutes against Chile and I think we'll definitely have our opportunities to win." 
He added: "We exposed Chile a lot on the wings, we have a lot of speed on the sides and we have Timmy (Cahill) that's one of the best headers in the game, so if we can get into wide areas and get some good crosses in, I think it's going to be tough for any side to stop us."
