Greece, Nigeria play out goalless stalemate
Greece and Nigeria battled to a scoreless draw on Tuesday in an international friendly match that served as a 2014 FIFA World Cup™ warm-up for both teams. 
Greece had their fair share of chances, but couldn't get past Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, who made a superb double save on Georgios Samaras and Dimitris Salpingidis in the 8rd minute. 
Greece had the majority of the opportunities in the first half as well, with Lazaros Christodoulopoulos firing a 30-yard rocket that just went high in the 21st minute. Ioannis Fetfatzidis was turned away in the 28th minute by Enyeama. 
Early in the second half, Nigeria picked up their attack on the strength of Chelsea attacker Victor Moses, but his runs from the left wing came to nothing. In the 90th minute, Moses belted a shot from just outside the box that went wide. 
Nigeria were coming off a 2-2 draw against Scotland in a friendly in London. The CAF Africa Cup of Nations champions will play USA in Jacksonville, Florida, in another friendly on Saturday and kick off their games in Brazil against Iran on 16 June in Curitiba. They will also face Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Group F. 
Greece will play Bolivia in Harrison, New Jersey, on Friday before heading for their base camp in Brazil at Aracaju. 
Greece have never qualified for the knockout stages in their previous appearances at the finals but will fancy their chances as they have been drawn in Group C with Colombia, who will be without talismanic striker Radamel Falcao, Japan and the talented but ageing Côte d'Ivoire. Greece open their campaign against Colombia on 14 June in Belo Horizonte.
