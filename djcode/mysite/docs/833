Hernandez left on the bench for Group A clash with Cameroon
Manchester United striker Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez has paid for a frustrating season with his club by being relegated to the bench for Mexico's opening World Cup Group A tie with Cameroon on Friday. 
Hernandez only started six league games for a struggling United side this season, managing just four goals in 24 appearances, 18 as a substitute, in the Premier League. Instead, coach Miguel Herrera, who Thursday named his entire starting line-up for the game in Natal, has opted for in-form duo Oribe Peralta and Giovani dos Santos. 
"There is very good chemistry between them," said Herrera as a way of explanation for Hernandez's omission. 
The other main selection was that of Ajaccio goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa over Jose Corona and Alfredo Talavera. Mexico come into the tournament on the back of a poor qualification campaign in which they finished fourth in the CONCACAF final group and needed a play-off against New Zealand to secure their place in Brazil. 
However, ten of their squad played in the gold medal-winning side at the London 2012 Olympic Games that beat Brazil in the final. They will also face Brazil and Croatia in Group A at the World Cup.
