Cazorla, Koke defend Spanish attitude
Santi Cazorla has dismissed his team-mate Xabi Alonso's comments that Spain were knocked out of the FIFA World Cup™ after two games because of a lack of "hunger and ambition". 
The Arsenal midfielder also lent his support to 
 coach Vicente del Bosque, while insisting that the national team has a bright future ahead and would bounce back from their shock early exit from the tournament they won four years ago. 
Speaking at a press conference at Spain's training camp in Curitiba, Cazorla defended the team's attitude. 
"I don't think there was a lack of hunger or ambition, not at all," he said. "Chile and Holland overcame us, and that can happen in football. This is a great group and we have proved that by winning so much." 

Fellow midfielder Koke spoke along similar lines, putting Spain's elimination down to a series of errors rather than a problem in the team's attitude and vowing to beat Australia in their final Group B game next week. 
"Things didn't work out for us, but all we need to do is correct our errors," he said. "We are going to finish the tournament well and try to beat Australia. 
"We have to learn from this. Luckily we are not used to situations like this but we have to retrace our steps if we are to win trophies again." 
The 22-year-old is likely to have a long future ahead of him in the Spain team and he believes the 2010 champions can return to the summit of world football again. 
"It's very difficult to achieve what this group have achieved, but a new generation full of strength and hope is coming through, and why can't we dream of doing that?" he said. 
"I'm just one more player that's going to fight for his national team and for his country."
