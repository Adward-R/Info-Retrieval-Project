Welbeck: I can't dance like the Brazilians
England are in Brazil on a serious assignment. That, however, has not stopped them engaging with the local public and enjoying some 
, a Brazilian martial art which combined dance, music and acrobatics.  
The Three Lions squad on Monday visited a sports complex on the edge of Rocinha, the largest favela in Rio de Janeiro, and the Football Association announced it will donate a five-figure sum to the foundation through its 'England Footballers' Foundation' charity.



There, the likes of Steven Gerrard, Jack Wilshere and Wayne Rooney chatted to thrilled children - and Danny Welbeck proved that he can dance! As the implausibly talented Brazilians showcased their 
, the England No11 exercised his impressive flexibility to imitate them. Afterwards, 
caught up with Welbeck for an exclusive chat.  
 


 Haha, I don't think I can do them as good as these lot, but I can maybe learn a bit more over the next couple of days. 





Yeah, I am, I'm really enjoying it. Obviously it's only the second day we've been here, and we've really enjoyed the first couple of days. Going to training today, this morning, it was hot but we've prepared ourselves well for these conditions.




Yeah, definitely, it's obviously humbling to see that backdrop in the background and it's something that you really take note of; it's something that you can't miss. 

And it's something to see all these kids here enjoying the stuff that they do, and you really take that into considerationÂ .





Yeah, I think so, because obviously we've brought good funding to this charity and [have] obviously been helping out, and to come and see it with your own eyes it's something that you can't get just through pictures. And you can also take that back to the other lads and let them know how it is and just spread the love, see how things are out here.
