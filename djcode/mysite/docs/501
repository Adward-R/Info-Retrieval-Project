amine1milan takes top prize as ranttis assumes leadership
An attack comprising Karim Benzema, Luis Suarez and Islam Slimani, who seized 44 points between them, powered 
 to the highest Matchday 2 score and a fantastic prize. An adidas 2014 FIFA World Cup brazuca ball, a signed captain’s armband from a match Brazil 2014, and a PlayStation®3 copy of the EA SPORTS™ 2014 FIFA World Cup game are on their way to the Algerian, who collected 24 points for selecting Ivan Perisic as captain.  
 came second to win an Argentina national team replica jersey and a PlayStation®3 copy of the EA SPORTS™ 2014 FIFA World Cup game. All six of the Mexican’s defensive players – Guillermo Ochoa, Miguel Layun, Rafael Marquez, Marcos Rojo, Eugenio Mena and Daniel van Buyen – hit double-digits, while having Benzema as skipper was worth 32 points.

The only outfield member of the Algeria squad based in Africa, the little-known 27-year-old cost just 1m – and not many coached elected to part with that to sign him. Those who did will have been extremely satisfied after Algeria’s second run-out in Brazil. As well as picking up a couple of points for winning back possession against Korea Repulic, Djabou scored and got an assist in a 4-2 victory, earning himself 14 points in the process.  
 Hulk (Brazil), Cesc Fabregas (Spain), Jackson Martinez (Colombia) and Lukas Podolski (Germany) cost a cool 7.5m apiece. The quarter returned zero points between them.  
 Croatia (114 points), Chile (112), Nigeria (103) 

Niko Kovac’s charges thrashed Cameroon 4-0. Five of them seized over ten points, with Vedran Corluka (17) leading the way followed by Mario Mandzukic, Danijel Pranjic (both 13), Ivan Perisic (12) and Dejan Lovren (11). 




 

With a -4 goal difference, Portugal simply have to go for goals against Ghana. Cristiano Ronaldo is certainly capable of scoring them, but the Iberians’ need to attack could leave gaps for Andre Ayew and Asamoah Gyan, who were both on target against Germany, to exploit.
