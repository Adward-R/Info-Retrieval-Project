Vidal: We can beat Brazil
Juventus star Arturo Vidal said that Chile were ready to realise their "dream" by overturning their jinx against five-time champions Brazil in the FIFA World Cup™ last 16. 
Vidal, who is recovering from injury and is on a yellow card, was rested for the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands which left Chile second in Group B and facing a knockout match with Brazil. 
But he said he would certainly play Saturday's game in Belo Horizonte as Chile aim to reverse World Cup last-16 defeats to Brazil in 1998 and 2010. 
"I'll play the round of 16 match on Saturday," he said. "I wouldn't miss it for the world. Brazil has often been Chile's nemesis but football changes, new generations come and new players appear." 
Despite Monday's defeat, confidence is high for Chile after they beat reigning world champions Spain to reach the second round. 
"Beating Brazil? That's our dream," Vidal continued. "Chile can create a surprise. We've beaten the world champions, so we can beat Brazil."
