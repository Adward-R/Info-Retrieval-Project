Klose reveals Gotze message
Miroslav Klose revealed he told Mario Goetze he could prove to be the match-winner when the hero of Germany's FIFA World Cup™ triumph replaced the veteran striker on Sunday. Klose, 36, made way for Goetze two minutes from the end of normal time at Estadio Maracana. Goetze then duly delivered a 113th minute winner as Germany clinched their fourth world title. 
"Before Mario came on for me, I said to him 'You can make it happen,'" said Klose, who became the all-time leading FIFA World Cup goalscorer in Brazil by scoring his 16th goal in his fourth finals. 
Klose, the only player to remain from the Germany team beaten by Brazil in the 2002 final, said the victory more than made up for a series of near-misses. 
"It's outstanding, this crowns everything," he said "We finished second once, were third twice, but this is world-class, I can hardly comprehend it. It was always a dream to once be up there (getting the trophy) and not just having to stand around and have to applaud others.The team's performances were important, we wanted to keep our calm because we knew we had the better quality to win it."
