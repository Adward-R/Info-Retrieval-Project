Chile's Valdivia retires from international football
Chilean playmaker Jorge Valdivia has announced his international retirement after competing with his country at the FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil. 
The 30-year-old made the announcement on his Twitter account. 
"I've been asked if I've decided to quit the national side and the answer is yes," said Valdivia. 
"Thank you for everything and sorry for the mistakes I've made. From today I'm on the same side as you, as a fan, with all my best wishes for my teammates and for Chile." 
Valdivia, who has 60 caps for the national side, scored in Chile's 3-1 win over Australia in Brazil.  
A Palmeiras player since 2006, he spent two seasons with Al Ain from 2008-2010, and will return to the United Arab Emirates to play with Dibba Al Fujairah next season. 
Valdivia leaves the national side less than a year before the Copa America, which will be played in Chile.
