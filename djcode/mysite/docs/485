Wilmots: Play effective, not beautiful 
Relieved at securing qualification for the Round of 16 at the FIFA World Cup™ with a late winner against Russia, Belgium coach Marc Wilmots ventured to embark upon an age-old debate.  
Is it enough to win, or must success be achieved in aesthetically pleasing fashion? 
Brazil fans have asked the question for decades, demanding not just success, of which they have had plenty down the years, but glory embellished with style. Any deviance from the path of 
 (the beautiful game) has been met with popular irritation and a nagging sense of unfulfilment. 
Wilmots says he and other coaches will be judged above all by results, leading him to an inescapable conclusion liable to dismay the romantic. 
"It's not about being beautiful -- but about being effective. Belgium are through to the next round and that is what counts," said the 45-year-old, who appeared for the Red Devils at four World Cups including their last appearance at a major finals in 2002.  
He added: "We are tactically very disciplined and we needed to be patient."
