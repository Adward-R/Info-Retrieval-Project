Sturridge hoping to 'get it done'
Daniel Sturridge wants to take the lessons learnt from his season with Liverpool as England head into their vital FIFA World Cupâ„¢ clash with Uruguay.
 
An opening-game loss to Italy means Roy Hodgson's men have it all to do in Group D and they could need two wins from their remaining two games to progress. 
A draw with Uruguay and a win over Costa Rica could also be enough, but Sturridge knows the risk of leaving things to chance. 
Liverpool went close in the English Premier League title race but in the end were pipped by Manchester City, who never blinked after the Reds let them back in. 
We now have two games to get the job done.

"A draw could be enough but what I learned at Liverpool is that if it's in your hands it's best to try and get it done and deal with it yourselves than ask for favours," he said. 
"There are no guarantees. You try your best to get the job done. We understand what we have to do, it's not rocket science.  
"We have two games and need a minimum of four points. We have to try and do that. We have a lot of confidence, adrenaline and no nerves. 
"I think expectation comes from everybody else, we go out there and play our way and as well as we can as a team. We realise what sort of squad we have, a mix of youth and experience. We now have two games to get the job done."
