Bacca ruled out of group stage
Colombia striker Carlos Bacca has a leg injury and will be out for the rest of the FIFA World Cup™ group stage.
 
The Sevilla player sustained a leg muscle strain in training and will be sidelined for Thursday's game with Côte d'Ivoire and the match against Japan on 24 June. 
A statement from Colombia's Football Federation read: "Following the tests done by Colombia's medical team, led by Doctor Carlos Ulloa, it has been determined that player Carlos Bacca has suffered a first degree muscle strain and will require a period of treatment from seven to 10 days." 
Bacca was on the bench for Colombia's 3-0 triumph over Greece in their Group C opener on Saturday, but the 27-year-old's absence is a blow for 
 coach Jose Pekerman considering his solid season with Sevilla. 
The forward scored 14 league goals in 35 Primera Liga appearances and was voted by Spanish sports newspaper 
 as the best signing of the 2013/14 La Liga season.
