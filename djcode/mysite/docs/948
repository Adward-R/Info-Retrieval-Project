Fred secures Brazil win over Serbia
Brazil completed their FIFA World Cupâ„¢ warm-up with a 1-0 win friendly over Serbia. 
Fred netted the only goal at the Estadio Morumbi in Sao Paulo in Brazil's final test before their host-nation debut against Croatia in the tournament's opening game next Thursday. 
That match will be played in the same city, but at a different venue - the Arena Corinthians. 
Despite being so close to the beginning of the official competition, Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari fielded most of his usual starters such as Neymar, Daniel Alves and Thiago Silva and may therefore be concerned at the nature of the performance. 
The Selecao were unable to break the tough Serbian defensive line until the 58th minute. 
Silva passed the ball to Fred, who chested it down, avoided the mark of a defender and managed to finish the play despite falling down on the grass. 
As Brazil made a number of substitutions, they failed to hurt Serbia again. 
One player to worry about for Scolari is defender Maicon, who ended the match with pain in his right leg. 
"Today's rivals were both physically and defensively strong," striker Hulk told Globoesporte.com after the game. 
"We found it diffucult to break two four-man defensive lines. We needed some patience."
