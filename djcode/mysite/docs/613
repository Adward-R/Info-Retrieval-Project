Swiss dream of beating 'difficult' France
Switzerland must find weaknesses in the French team as 
 will offer the Swiss precious few chances in Friday's key FIFA World Cupâ„¢ clash, according to Swiss assistant coach Michel Pont. 
"It is extremely difficult to find weaknesses in the France team, it's the first time in 13 years that I've struggled to find them," said Ottmar Hitzfeld's deputy, who has been involved with the team since 2001."It is very well organised, compact defence, who make individual sacrifices which is down to the will of the players. We have to find weaknesses by jumping on every opportunity. If we try and pack all 10 players behind the ball, it won't work, we have to challenge them." 
Both teams won their openers with France topping the table after a convincing 3-0 win over Honduras. The Swiss secured a last-gasp victory over Ecuador as substitute Haris Seferovic netted in the last minute of injury time to claim a 2-1 come-back victory. 
"You have to get at the French and try to disrupt this magnificent machine," said Pont, talking up Didier Deschamps' side. "We have to make them doubt their game, but I don't think we can do that by physical impact. We have to move the ball, run a lot and make them doubt their grip on the game." 
Sixth-placed Switzerland are 11 places higher than the French according to FIFA's rankings, but they insist those standings mean nothing. 
"Us, favourites? Absolutely not," said Pont, who turns 60 on Thursday. "My dream is to beat France, it would be the greatest gift, and then go as far as possible. I am convinced that if we leave the group, we are able to go very far."
