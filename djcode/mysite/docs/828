De Gea: Van Gaal can bring glory
David de Gea is confident Louis van Gaal can return Manchester United to glory next season. 
The goalkeeper will be sitting just a few metres away from his new boss on Friday evening when Netherlands face Spain in the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ Group B opener in Salvador de Bahia, and will also be watching team-mate Robin van Persie lead the Dutch attack. 
"He has won everything as a coach," De Gea said of Netherlands coach Van Gaal in an interview with 
. "He's a very good coach and I think he's going to bring a lot to Manchester United, important and innovative ideas and I think he's going to be very good for us." 
Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes was criticised for negative tactics in his doomed nine-month spell in charge at Old Trafford, but De Gea believes the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach will get United playing more exciting football again. He added: "He's going to help us a lot because he's going to bring a different style of play." 
Spain's third choice goalkeeper behind Iker Casillas and Pepe Reina, De Gea will be watching the game from the dugout, and revealed he has been speaking to Van Persie about it: "I've sent him the odd message. He's a great player and we'll have to follow him closely. I hope that he has a quiet game." 
De Gea has spent the last three seasons with United and explained he was delighted to be playing his football in England. He concluded: "It's a great place to play football, the fans respect you a lot, it's wondrous."
