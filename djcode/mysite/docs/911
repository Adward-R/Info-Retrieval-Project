Minda replaces Castillo in Ecuador squad
Oswaldo Minda earned a late call-up to Ecuador's FIFA World Cup™ squad on Sunday as a replacement for injured midfielder Segundo Castillo. Castillo, who plays his club football for Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, lost his battle to be fit after injuring ligaments in his right knee during a friendly with Mexico on May 31. 
"In spite of his determined efforts and those of the medical team he will not be fit in time for the World Cup," the Ecuador Football Federation said in a statement. 
Minda, 30, was in coach Reinaldo Rueda's provisional 30-man squad but was left out when the final list of 23 was submitted. Ecuador, who reached the Round of 16 in their last appearance at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany™, have been drawn in Group E along with France, Switzerland and minnows Honduras, whom Rueda coached at the 2010 World Cup finals. 
They open their campaign against the Swiss on Saturday in Brasilia.
