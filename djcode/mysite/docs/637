Referee designations for matches 24-26 
FIFA has announced the referees for the FIFA World Cup™ matches 24 to 26. Enrique Osses will referee the match Italy-Costa Rica, two teams who meet after winning their first games.  
The 40-year-old Chilean has already officiated a match at the 2014 FIFA World Cup™, Cote d’Ivoire-Japan, which was also played in Recife. In 2012, Osses oversaw his first Copa Libertadores final and he has handled the return leg of each of the last two Copa Sudamericana title-deciders. His first FIFA competition was the FIFA Club World Cup 2011, followed by two games at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013.  
Björn Kuipers will take charge of the match between two European teams who have also both won their first encounters, Switzerland-France. Kuipers is 41 and from the Netherlands. Among the highlights in his refereeing career are several finals, including Brazil-Spain at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 and, more recently, the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Atlético de Madrid. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he officiated the match between England-Italy.  
The Australian man in black Benjamin Williams will referee his first match at this tournament, Honduras-Ecuador. Williams is 37-years-old and can boast the 2012 Olympic Football Tournaments and the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2013 on his CV. He has overseen two Champions League finals in two different confederations: for the OFC in 2007 and for the AFC in 2012. Honduras and Ecuador both lost their first matches.
