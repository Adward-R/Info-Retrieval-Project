Brazil-Colombia: What the celebs say...
“After what I have seen from Brasil so far, I think Colombia has a very good chance of beating Brazil!”



“I fancy Colombia to do Brazil tonight. James to shine.”


(
), former England midfielder, to FIFA.com



"Neymar versus Rodriguez, clash of young stars, the main event, the world watching with anticipation. As great as Colombia have been, I just don't see Brazil ready to let the country down yet."





“One of the most exciting games yet. Will Brazil be able to manage the pressure and emotion of this South American quarter-final?”


“It's a huge test for Brazil against the most consistent team so far. But this is also Colombia's first game against a top side. A different challenge. Brazil must handle Rodriguez and Cuadrado, but if they can isolate Yepes with Neymar attacking, Brazil will win.”



 

“Brazil isn't playing the best football right now. They seem to be doing just enough to win. They can't have that same approach against Colombia. Rodriguez is on fire right now and the team is playing with a tremendous amount of confidence and passion. I think Colombia wins.”


 
“Backed Brazil to win it before the tournament started. Despite the absence of a playmaker, still could do enough to Beat Columbia 2-0.”





“I think Colombia could shock the hosts. They've been a strong, consistent team all tournament and I think it's time for an upset!”


 
"We Brazilians are resigned to suffer a lot, as we did against Chile, because Colombia play really well and they’ve revealed in the course of the tournament the talent of James Rodriguez. He is a very special boy. I hope we can do it. I have a fair amount of confidence, but I’m not sure.”
