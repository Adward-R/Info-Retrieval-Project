Seferovic: Goal is for my father
Switzerland's Haris Seferovic has declared his match-winning goal against Ecuador a birthday present to his father. Seferovic scored in added time to complete a 2-1 comeback victory for his side, just 15 minutes after coming off the bench. 
It provided a thrilling finale to the Group E clash in Brasilia, with Ecuador having launched their last attack moments prior to conceding at the other end. And Seferovic revealed his intervention came on a special day for his family. 
"I give a big thank you to my father, it was his birthday and I dedicate my goal to him," he said. "There is nothing better than achieving a goal like this and until I scored I had not seen a lot of the ball, but when it comes to it you have to be ready."

Haris Seferovic, Switzerland striker
Having slipped behind to Enner Valencia's opener, Switzerland needed another substitute to draw level. Admir Mehmedi was the scorer with his first touch since coming on at the interval. 
"Of course I was disappointed that I did not have the chance to play from the beginning but I was ready for my role," he added. "As a striker, you have to stand where I stood, one against one. Crucially, we never gave up. Morale and team spirit were the decisive factor for us."
