Rooney: 'Hurting' England must restore pride
England striker Wayne Rooney said on Saturday that his side were "hurting" after their early World Cup elimination and urged his team-mates to "restore pride" against Costa Rica on Tuesday. 
"Obviously we're hurting," the Manchester United striker told a press conference at England's Rio de Janeiro training base. "It's really disappointing to be out of the tournament, so I'm sure you can imagine it's quite tough. There'll be a long few days for us now and we have to try and pick ourselves up for this game on Tuesday, go out fighting and show our pride." 
England lost their first two Group D games 2-1 against Italy and Uruguay and were eliminated on Friday after the Italians lost 1-0 to Costa Rica in Recife. It is the first time England have gone out in the first phase of a World Cup since the 1958 tournament in Sweden. 
However, English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has confirmed that England manager Roy Hodgson will stay on until UEFA EURO 2016 and Rooney says the squad were fully behind him. 
"Make no doubt about it - Roy is the man to take this team forward. We appreciate what he has done for us," Rooney said. "He has put a great enthusiasm in the team, a great set of young, exciting players in place. 
"He has, in my opinion, changed the way we have played over the last couple of years and I know the results have been disappointing in the last two games, but as a team we can feel we are getting better. I feel with the young lads in the squad, this will help them and hopefully in the future this will make us a better team."
