Hodgson: No thought of resignation
Roy Hodgson has no intention of quitting as England coach despite the Three Lions' damaging FIFA World Cupâ„¢ defeat by Uruguay.
 
England were left on the brink of elimination thanks to a clinical double from Liverpool forward Luis Suarez in Sao Paulo. 
The 27-year-old scored both of his side's goals, including an 85th-minute winner, as England suffered a 2-1 loss - their second reverse in five days. 
If Costa Rica and Italy draw on Friday afternoon, or the Central Americans beat Cesare Prandelli's charges, Hodgson's team will be eliminated with one match to spare. 
I'm bitterly disappointed, of course, but I don't feel I need to resign.

The only way England will stay in the FIFA World Cup is if Italy win both of their remaining games, and they claim a big victory against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. 
A potential FIFA World Cup group-stage exit for the first time since 1958 will not cause Hodgson to quit his role, though. 
"I don't have any intention to resign," he said. "I'm bitterly disappointed, of course, but I don't feel I need to resign, no." 
He continued: "On the other hand, and if the FA think I'm not the right man to do the job, that will be their decision, and not mine. I've been really happy with the way the players have responded to the work we've tried."
