7 days to go 
Brazil-Sweden and Germany-Yugoslavia/Serbia are the most-played fixtures in the FIFA World Cup™, having been contested seven times apiece.  
Sadly, with the Swedes and Serbians both having failed to qualify, there will be no eighth meeting for either of these familiar rivals at Brazil 2014.  
In World Cup trivia, seven could also stand for the number of minutes required to score the tournament's fastest hat-trick, with Hungary's Laszlo Kiss the man responsible in his team's record-breaking 10-1 victory over El Salvador in 1982.
