Eto'o misses training with knee problem
Samuel Eto'o has missed two days of training with an injured knee and is battling to be fit for Cameroon's FIFA World Cup™ Group A game against Croatia, coach Volker Finke said today. 
"He has a problem with the right knee that he already had at the end of the season with his club Chelsea," Finke told a press conference. 
"He did not train yesterday nor today," the coach added. 
Cameroon play Croatia on Wednesday in Manaus needing a victory to maintain their hopes of qualifying for the Round of 16. They play their last group game against Brazil on 23 June.
