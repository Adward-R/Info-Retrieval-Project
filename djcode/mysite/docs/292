Lahm: Deliver now or we go home
Germany must prove themselves as potential FIFA World Cup™ winners with a commanding display in their Round of 16 clash against Algeria, insisted captain Philipp Lahm.
 
The versatile defender said Joachim Low's team must justify their place among the favourites to lift the Trophy or risk a shock exit at the hands of the African side. 
Germany have lost each of their two previous matches against Algeria - 2-1 at the 1982 FIFA World Cup and 2-0 in a 1964 friendly - with the latest winner set to play France or Nigeria in Rio de Janeiro. 
"We're in the knockout phase - either you deliver or you go home," said the 30-year-old. "Germany have been world champions three times and there aren't that many teams who can say that. 
"We have had great teams in the past and this squad has great potential, but we have to take it a round at a time and play aggressively. I think we are the better team, but we have to prove that on the pitch."
