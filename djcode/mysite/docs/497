Chile to gamble on Vidal
Jorge Sampaoli is ready to risk suspension for star midfielder Arturo Vidal as they look to go all out in order to beat the Netherlands and avoid a likely knock-out clash with Brazil at the FIFA World Cup™. The Chile boss said it was vital for his side to top their group and stay away from the fellow South American side, who are favourites to win Group A and play the second-placed team in Group B. 
Juventus' Vidal is carrying a yellow card, meaning another caution on Monday would rule him out for the Round of 16, but Sampaoli indicated Chile would throw caution to the wind as they face the free-scoring Dutch, who beat 2010 World Cup holders Spain 5-1 and overcame Australia 3-2. 
"There is a context which is real, which is protecting a player and that's respectable," Sampaoli said. "But we need to win the group because that will give us a way of looking to the future in a different manner." 
Internacional midfielder Charles Aranguiz has also recovered from injury, giving Sampaoli a full squad to choose from for Monday's Group B decider in Sao Paulo. 
This is the best generation of Chilean football in our history.

"For us the priority is to win the group. Tomorrow's match will be like a final," he said. "I think we have the power to overcome certain deficiencies of Holland." 
Vidal indicated confidence was sky-high in the camp after their 3-1 win over Australia followed by the shock 2-0 victory over Spain. 
"If we play the same as we played against Spain we can make it all the way to the final. But of course we have to prove it and we have to live up to our own expectations," Vidal said. "This is the best generation of Chilean football in our history. 
"We have a lot of players who are playing outside Chile and when we come together we are playing stronger than anything we have seen before in Chile."
