Klinsmann: We will give everything
Jurgen Klinsmann has insisted the United States will be playing to win when they face a Germany team managed by his old friend Joachim Loew on Thursday. USA's thrilling 2-2 draw with Portugal in Group G on Sunday has left Klinsmann's side level on four points heading into their final game. 
A draw in Thursday's match in Recife would see Germany qualify as group winners with the United States finishing runners up and Klinsmann says that optimism is high in the American camp. 
"We have that fighting spirit, and we give everything in every game," said Klinsmann. "We will go to Recife and we will give everything to beat Germany. That is our goal." 
Klinsmann added that even though he was good friends with Loew, his assistant during his time as Germany coach, it will be business as usual when the USA take on Germany in their final Group G game. 
"Jogi is doing his job. We are good friends, and I am doing my job. My job is to get everything done to get us into the Round of 16, and that is what I'm going to do. There is no time now to have friendship calls. That time is done. 
"Both teams go into this game and they want to win the group. So we go into this game and try to beat Germany. To put ourselves in the driver seat for the last-16, that is our goal."
