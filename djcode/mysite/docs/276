Injured De Jong out of the World Cup
The Netherlands will be without Nigel de Jong for the rest of the FIFA World Cup™ through injury. The 29-year-old was forced off nine minutes into the Oranje's last-16 clash against Mexico on Sunday with a groin complaint. 
The Netherlands' coach Louis van Gaal admitted after the 2-1 win that De Jong was a doubt for their quarter-final match against Costa Rica and the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) have now confirmed his tournament is over. 
A post on their Twitter account, @KNVB, said: "Nigel de Jong has a tear in his groin muscle. He's probably out for two to four weeks. De Jong continues rehabilitation with #Orange." 
With the World Cup final on 13 July, the AC Milan midfielder would be up against it to recover in time. "An MRI examination at hospital confirmed that Nigel de Jong is struggling with a tear in his groin muscle," the KNVB said in a statement. 
  
The confidence within our team is very big, in spite of any absence

"The 75-times capped international is therefore presumably out for two to four weeks. De Jong, who in last Sunday's match against Mexico was injured after nine minutes, remains with the team in Brazil to work there on his rehabilitation." 
The Oranje are looking to reach their second-successive World Cup final and winger, Arjen Robben, speaking before the severity of the injury became clear, admitted De Jong would be a great miss.  
"It's a hard blow for us that Nigel has been injured," the winger said. "The possible absence of De Jong in the quarter-finals is a heavy loss. But our strength is that every player who comes off the bench on to the pitch manages to have a big impact on the match. The confidence within our team is very big, in spite of any absence."
