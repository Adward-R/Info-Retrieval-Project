Eriksson: England better in 2006
Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson on Saturday wrote off Roy Hodgson's hopes of winning the FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil and claimed his 2006 side had more to offer. 
Eriksson took England to the quarter-finals in Germany eight years ago and believes Hodgson will be lucky to get as far in South America. "I don't think any team were better than England at the World Cup in Germany," the 66-year-old told the BBC. "I don't believe England have the chance to win this time. The quarter-finals would be a good achievement." 
Under Eriksson, England reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 and 2006 World Cups as well as the same last-eight stage of the 2004 UEFA European Championships. Only Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard from the 2006 tournament in Germany, where England were knocked out by Portugal on penalties, have survived to play under Hodgson in Brazil. 
"We lost on penalties again but I don't think Portugal, or any team, were better than us at that time. The margins are very small," insisted Eriksson. "This time England has changed a lot, with new players. I think they will go through the group stage and then it depends on who they meet."
