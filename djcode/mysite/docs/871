Suker: I hope Croatia can do even better than 1998
Davor Suker knows all too well what it takes to leave a mark at the FIFA World Cup™. At France 1998, he fired unfancied Croatia to third place and pocketed the adidas Golden Boot in the process. The former Sevilla, Real Madrid and Arsenal striker hung up his boots in 2003, but he will be involved in his country’s quest for success in Brazil as president of the Croatian Football Federation (HNS). 
caught up with the 46-year-old to hear about his admiration for the host nation, what Brazilians and Croatians have in common, the Opening Match in Sao Paulo and the formula required to spring a surprise at the World Cup. 


 


 


 
I have always admired them for going out to play beautiful football.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Fernando Torres, Mario Mandzukic, Neymar, Fred... there are currently so many good players in each team. It's very difficult to say. But there is always one surprise player that can score many goals. I hope that we will score more goals than we concede. I am sure we will have a great World Cup and see good strikers and I would like to see some Croatian strikers top the goal-scorers' ranking.
