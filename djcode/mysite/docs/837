FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil to promote peace and fight all forms of discrimination
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and FIFA President Blatter used the occasion of the opening match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ to call on governments, civil society, the football community, participants and fans, to reaffirm the importance of promoting peace and fighting all forms of discrimination during the events of the FIFA World Cup and beyond.  
Sport has the power to bring people together from all walks of life. Through the popularity of football in particular, important values and messages of peace and equality can be spread and help make a difference in modern day society.  
The following joint message will be communicated in the stadium ahead of each of the FIFA World Cup™ matches:  
“Today we come together to strive not only for victory in the game, but also for the victory of peace. Brazil, the United Nations and FIFA wish to share a message of peace, tolerance and respect for human rights. United in spirit with all players, officials and fans around the world we join our voices to fight all forms of discrimination and in favour of mutual respect, regardless of gender, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion or class. These are universal values and aspirations that we pledge to continue to promote in this World Cup and beyond.”
