Mascherano admits to 'immense pain'
An emotional Javier Mascherano said he felt "immense pain" after losing the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ Final against Germany.
 
Mario Gotze struck in the 113th minute to give the Europeans a 1-0 win over the South Americans at the Maracana. Mascherano was proud to have made it to the Final, but he admitted losing in such a dramatic way was hard to take. 
"The pain is immense," the Argentina vice-captain said with tears in his eyes. "We wanted to win this for the people of Argentina, for those who came here to support us, but we lost. 
"We have represented our country the best we could, though. We have to lift our heads despite the pain. We gave everything we could out there." 
Gonzalo Higuain missed a good chance in the first half and Lionel Messi spurned a similar opportunity after the break, while substitute Rodrigo Palacio was wasteful when clean through in extra time. 
Mascherano wishes his team-mates had put their chances away. "We had the best chances but we didn't take them," the Barcelona midfielder said. 
"And we only had to last another five minutes at the end. We just didn't have that little bit of luck that you need in a final."
