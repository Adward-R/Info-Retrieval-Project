3 days to go 
At South Africa 2010, Jerry, Jhony and Wilson Palacios made FIFA World Cup™ history by becoming the first three brothers to be named in the same squad.  
However, while Honduras have once again qualified for the World Cup, there will be no reunion for the trio at Brazil 2014, with Jhony having failed to make the squad.  
Jerry and Wilson will be involved, though, and they will not be the only brothers at the tournament. Andre and Jordan Ayew both figure in Ghana's 23, while Côte d'Ivoire are sure to lean heavily on the experience of Kolo and Yaya Toure. 
Jerome and Kevin-Prince Boateng will also be sharing a pitch, although unlike their fellow siblings, they will be on opposing teams, with the latter lining up for the Black Stars and the former representing Group G rivals Germany.
