Kick-off event set to launch 2014 FIFA Fan Fest
The FIFA Fan Fest for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ will come to life in spectacular fashion on Sunday, with an entertainment extravaganza lined up for fans attending the kick-off event on Iracema Beach in Fortaleza. 



The event will open its doors to the public at 16:00 local time with DJs, comedians and three Brazilian bands set to entertain the crowds. The set-up of the event will be exactly the same as during Brazil 2014, with a huge screen showing iconic FIFA World Cup footage and a stage featuring top Brazilian entertainment.



FIFA’s Commercial Affiliates will also be onsite, with a number of activities arranged to keep fans entertained in between the acts. 



The three Brazilian music acts who have confirmed their participation in the show are Bell Marques, (former lead singer of the band 
), singer and accordionist Dorgival Dantas and the duo Simone and Simaria. 



The kick-off event will signal the first public event of the FIFA Fan Fest for the Brazil 2014, before the FIFA Fan Fest opens its doors in all 12 Host Cities on 12 June for the Opening Game between Brazil and Croatia.



The FIFA Fan Fest will then remain open for the rest of the tournament, broadcasting all matches to Brazilian and international fans in a family-friendly, entertaining environment.
