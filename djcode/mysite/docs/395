Ghana pair suspended and sent home
Two of Ghana's star players have been suspended from the team just hours before their crucial World Cup match against Portugal. AC Milan's Sulley Muntari and Schalke's Kevin-Prince Boateng have both had their World Cup accreditation withdrawn, the Ghana FA (GFA) announced. 
The two former Portsmouth players will play no part in Ghana's must-win last group match against Portugal in Brasilia on Thursday. Boateng "verbally abused" coach Kwesi Appiah, said the GFA. 
A statement from the association said: "The GFA has suspended Sulley Ali Muntari indefinitely from the Black Stars with immediate effect. The decision was taken in the wake of his unprovoked physical attack on an executive committee member of the GFA and a management member of the Black Stars, Mr Moses Armah on Tuesday 24th June, 2014 during a meeting. 
"The GFA has approved coach Kwesi Appiah's decision to suspend Kevin-Prince Boateng indefinitely from the Black Stars. The decision was taken following Boateng's vulgar verbal insults targeted at coach Kwesi Appiah during the team's training session in Maceio this week. Boateng has since showed no remorse for his actions which has resulted in the decision." 
The statement said both Muntari and Boateng's accreditation for the World Cup has been withdrawn "with immediate effect".
