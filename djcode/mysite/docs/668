Palacio back to fitness
Forward Rodrigo Palacio returned to full Argentina FIFA World Cup™ training on Tuesday following a sprained ankle and will be fit to face Iran on Saturday in Group F. 
The 32-year-old Inter Milan striker missed Sunday's 2-1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina and had not played since twisting his ankle in Argentina's penultimate warm-up, a 3-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago.Since then he had been subjected to a special training programme to recover. 
Argentina began their FIFA World Cup campaign in mixed fashion against Bosnia and Herzegovina which saw coach Alejandro Sabella make a half-time switch from playing three central defenders to a more traditional four at the back. The change to 4-3-3 also gave forwards Lionel Messi and Sergio Agüero more licence and support to attack, culminating in Messi being able to score the eventual winning goal; a goal that has been hailed by former Brazil star Zico as 'fantastic'.
