Brazil-Germany: Celebs predict to FIFA.com





“This is the mentality for today: fight with honour, fight for us, fight as a team, never leave one of ours behind. Go Brazil, do it for Neymar!" 




 

"Germany should be far too strong for a Brazil side lacking two key players. The hosts' run ends here. German machine keeps rolling."


“We will have ‘another Final’ like the match in 2002! It will be a fantastic match and I believe we will have the same score (2-0 to Brazil).”







"From favorite to underdog, the time is now for Hulk & his Brazil team-mates to rise up to the challenge. Even with the odds against them without Thiago Silva and Neymar, I believe Brazil will find a way.”


 
 
“Brazil, for sure. It will be a tough match against the world’s best team, player for player. But Brazil will call on joyous tradition to win the match.” 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Neymar injured is a big loss to Brazil. Germany look stronger as a team. I think Germany will nab it.”


“It will be a great game! They’re two great teams and I’m certain that it’s going to be an amazing match. I hope Brazil emerge victorious and reach the final that’s been dreamt about so much!”
