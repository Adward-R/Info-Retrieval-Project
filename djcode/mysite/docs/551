 Susic: Dzeko is Bosnia's Messi
Safet Susic believes Edin Dzeko has a similar role to play for Bosnia-Herzegovina as Lionel Messi does for Argentina. Head coach Susic will be counting on the Manchester City striker in their crucial Group F ame against Nigeria in Cuiaba. 
The Bosnians are going all out for a win, Susic said, even though a draw would suffice after their opening loss to Argentina. Defeat against Nigeria would end Bosnia's interest in the FIFA World Cup™.  
The importance of Dzeko, an integral part of the City team that won two English Premier League titles in the past three years, was noted by Susic. “Dzeko is equally important to us as Ronaldo is for Portugal, as Neymar is to Brazil and as Messi is to Argentina," the Bosnia coach said.  
Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic says his team are fully focused on the task in hand. “We're raring to go, if we lose it's over for us, we won't let that happen,” he said. “We will fight, not just for us but for the country.” 
Nigeria, Panic added, were not African champions by chance. “I`m sure they didn't play their best against Iran (0-0). The pressure is a bit greater on us, but we are convinced in our strength, we believe we will win tomorrow.” 
Susic, a world class attacking midfielder in his playing days, was in equally bullish mood. “Everyone is aware of how important tomorrow's game is. We are in the most uncomfortable of positions. 
"But we haven't come here to learn, we have players in top class European clubs, players who have acquired a great deal of experience. We have self-imposed ambitions to make it out of the group, and so not come here for people to see us, we have ambitions to progress out of the group, it won't be easy, but I'm convinced we haven't said our last words. After Argentina we are the best team in the group."
