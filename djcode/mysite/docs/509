Trio aware of France's forward threat
Ecuador are expecting to be overworked in defence during their FIFA World Cupâ„¢ clash with France at the Maracana on Wednesday.
 
 are the joint-top scorers at the tournament so far, having plundered eight goals in two games. 
Defender Frickson Erazo and midfielder Christian Noboa are preparing to be called in for overtime in their defensive duties in their final Group E match in Rio de Janeiro. 
"The way to read it is that we're going to have a lot of work in defence," said Erazo. 
Noboa added: "They scored eight goals in one match [an 8-0 thumping of Jamaica in a FIFA World Cup warm-up]. Scoring a goal in a World Cup is difficult and scoring eight, that gives you a guide to what France are all about." 
Didier Deschamps' side opened up their campaign with a 3-0 win over Honduras before thumping Switzerland 5-2. 
In matches against the same teams, Ecuador lost 2-1 to the Swiss before scraping a win over Honduras by the same score. 
They sit second in the group but with Switzerland facing pointless Honduras in their last game, Ecuador are likely going to need a victory to progress to the Round of 16. 
"They're going to be very difficult opponents, we know France's strengths but we're going to have to take care if we want to hurt them," said Enner Valencia.
