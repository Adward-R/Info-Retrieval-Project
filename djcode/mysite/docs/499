Casillas, Xavi to miss Spain farewell
Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has confirmed that neither Iker Casillas nor Xavi Hernandez will start his side's final FIFA World Cup™ Group B game against Australia on Monday.
 
The reigning world and European champions have already been eliminated from the 2014 competition following defeats against Chile and the Netherlands. 
Casillas conceded seven goals in those two games and will be replaced by Pepe Reina as Del Bosque attempts to give minutes to all those in his squad that have yet to feature in the tournament. 
"For sure, Xavi will not play tomorrow because he has a slight muscular problem," said the former Real Madrid coach today. "Reina will definitely play." 
On Barcelona midfielder Xavi, Del Bosque added: "I don't think one game more or less is going to give him more recognition than he already has. 
"He was the player that covered the most ground from both teams in the game against the Netherlands. They talk about renovation and marginalising the veterans, as if we have failed purely because of them. It is everyone who has lost together, but our recognition of Xavi remains huge." 
 

The 31-year-old Reina will be making his first appearance at the FIFA World Cup and is determined to at least end a disappointing tournament on a high. 
"It is the dream of any player to play in a World Cup," said the Liverpool goalkeeper, who spent last season on loan at Napoli. "I wish it could be in different circumstances but the only thing we can't change is that we can't qualify. 
"I don't think we are going to change the opinion of the people a lot because we are already out, but we want to end the competition in the most dignified way possible."
