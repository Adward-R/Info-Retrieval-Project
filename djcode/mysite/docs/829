Referee designations for matches 5-8
FIFA has announced the referee designations for the matches 5-8, to be played on Saturday, 14 June 2014.



Colombia-Greece will be officiated by US referee Mark Geiger, who is 39. He supervised his first international in 2008 and was in charge for two finals in 2011: Costa Rica-Mexico in the CONCACAF U-20 Championship and Brazil-Portugal at the climax of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia. That same year, Geiger was named Major League Soccer Referee of the Year.



Enrique Osses will cover the Côte d'Ivoire-Japan contest. Osses, 40 and from Chile, became an international referee in 2005 and has handled the return leg of each of the last two title-deciders of the Copa Sudamericana. 



The Uruguay-Costa Rica game has been assigned to Felix Brych from Germany (38). He has refereed UEFA Champions League matches since 2008 and most recently led the 2014 UEFA Europa League final. In 2013, he handled Japan-Mexico in the FIFA Confederations Cup. 



The referee for England's showdown with Italy will be Bjorn Kuipers from the Netherlands. The 41-year-old has already supervised six international finals in his career including Brazil-Spain at the Maracana during the last FIFA Confederations Cup and most recently this year's UEFA Champions League decider in Lisbon.
