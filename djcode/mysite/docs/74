Gotze: It's an unbelievable feeling
FIFA World Cup Final™ match-winner Mario Gotze said he felt "unbelievable" after scoring the extra-time goal that gave Germany a 1-0 win over Argentina on Sunday. 
"It's an unbelievable feeling," said the Bayern Munich forward after etching his name into World Cup legend at the iconic Maracana. 
"I don't know how to describe it. You just score that goal and you don't really know what's happening after that. 
"It'll be a party with the whole team and the country. It's a dream come true to win the World Cup, especially in Brazil." 
After replacing Miroslav Klose in the 88th minute, Gotze's historic moment arrived seven minutes from the end of extra time when he chested down a cross from Andre Schurrle and lashed a volley past Sergio Romero. 
It was a cathartic moment for the 22-year-old, who left his boyhood club Borussia Dortmund for Bayern last year in a €37 million ($50.3 million) transfer that rocked German football. 
Gotze struggled to hold down a first-team place in his maiden campaign at Bayern and he admitted that he had endured a testing 12 months. 
"It hasn't been a simple year for me or a simple tournament. I owe a lot to my family and my girlfriend (model Ann Kathrin Brommel), who always believed in me," he said. 
"It's not been simple, but I am simply happy to be here. I kept on training and working hard, and we deserved this trophy."
