Susic extends Bosnia and Hezegovina contract
Bosnia and Herzegovina coach Safet Susic has signed a new contract to remain as head coach of the Balkan side for a further two years. The news comes after Susic led the Bosnians to their first ever FIFA World Cup™ appearance.  
"I said that to leave the team would be painful for me. And that moment has not yet come," Susic said to reporters on Wednesday. "I am really happy to be continuing." 
The former Paris Saint-Germain player has been in charge of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2009. The Bosnians were eliminated after the group stage of Brazil 2014 after a campaign that featured a 3-1 win over Iran and defeats to Nigeria and Argentina.
