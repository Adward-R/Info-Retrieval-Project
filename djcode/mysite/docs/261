Referee designations for matches 59 and 60
FIFA has announced the referees for FIFA World Cup™ matches 59 and 60. Ravshan Irmatov, 36 and from Uzbekistan, will officiate the quarter-final encounter between the Netherlands and Costa Rica. It will be Irmatov’s fourth match of the competition after Switzerland-Ecuador, Croatia-Mexico and USA-Germany. At South Africa 2010, he took charge of five matches, including the Dutch semi-final victory over Uruguay (3-2). Furthermore, he has an impressive list of FIFA competitions on his CV, such as four youth tournaments, three FIFA Club World Cups, the Olympic Football Tournament 2012 and most recently the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013.  
The quarter-final match between Argentina and Belgium will be refereed by Nicola Rizzoli. The 42-year-old Italian has already officiated two matches at Brazil 2014, namely Spain-Netherlands and Nigeria-Argentina. Rizzoli oversaw three matches at UEFA EURO 2012, including the quarter-final between Spain and France. He has also refereed two matches of both the FIFA Club World Cup 2011 and the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2013.
