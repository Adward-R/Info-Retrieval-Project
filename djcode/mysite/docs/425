Nigeria-Argentina: A rivalry that keeps on running
Since coming face-to-face at the 1994 FIFA World Cup USA™, Argentina and Nigeria have played each other time and again in major tournaments, crossing swords with such frequency that meetings between the two sides are almost to be expected now.
 
“It’s become a classic rivalry because we always, always, always play them,” joked Super Eagles coach Stephen Keshi following last December’s draw for Brazil 2014. A look at the record books shows that he's not far wrong. 
Their back catalogue features two finals in the Olympic Games – in 1996 and 2008 – three FIFA World Cup clashes and the final of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2005. Along the way the two sides have treated the world to some unforgettable moments, which 
 has decided to relive as an appetiser for their latest coming together in Porto Alegre on Wednesday. 
The highlights include Diego Maradona’s last FIFA World Cup appearance, a dazzling display by a fresh-faced Lionel Messi in the final at Netherlands 2005, Gabriel Batistuta’s goal against the Super Eagles at Korea/Japan 2002, and their most recent duel, at South Africa 2010.
