Messi laments lack of killer instinct
Argentina captain Lionel Messi regretted his side's missed chances after Germany beat his side 1-0 in the FIFA World Cup Final™ on Sunday thanks to Mario Gotze's extra time goal. 
Gonzalo Higuain, Rodrigo Palacio and Messi himself all passed up clear opportunities chances to put Argentina in front before Gotze struck seven minutes from time. 
"There is sadness to finish in this way, I think we deserved a little more today", said the Barcelona star. "The better chances were ours and between the forwards we couldn't take them," he told 
. 
Messi was still crowned as the player of the tournament for his performances and four goals in seven matches. However, he insisted the individual award was scant consolation for missing out on a much bigger collective prize. 
"We wanted to win the World Cup for all the people in Argentina and we couldn't do it," he said. "We tried, but we didn't have the luck we had in other games. 
And Messi insisted it was hard to take consolation from carrying his country to the final for the first time in 24 years in the immediate aftermath of the defeat. 
"After a long time not getting past the quarter-finals we managed to get to the final, but today there is the disappointment of having lost in the last minutes of extra time."
