Irmatov has refereed at ten FIFA competitions overall. Most recently, he took charge of Brazil-Italy at the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013. 



Referee for the second Group E game between France and Honduras will be Sandro Ricci from Brazil. He was the ‘Referee of the Year’ in his home country in 2010 and joined FIFA’s international list in 2011. In 2013, he oversaw four FIFA U-20 World Cup fixtures as well as a quarter-final and the final of the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco. 



Argentina against Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first match taking place at the Maracana, will be refereed by Joel Aguilar from El Salvador.
