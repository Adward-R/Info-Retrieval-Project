Tejeda: We didn't expect Greece
Greece's surprise qualification for the FIFA World Cup™ Round of 16 has forced Costa Rica to rewrite its strategy, Yeltsin Tejeda said on Wednesday. 
The midfielder told a press conference at Costa Rica's training base that the side were bracing themselves for a meet with either Colombia or Côte d'Ivoire in the next round, before Georgios Samaras' late penalty fired the Greeks through.   
He said: "We were thinking more about Colombia and the Ivory Coast and in the end came the least expected team. Now we have to change the video cassette." 
Costa Rica and Greece have both been surprise packages at the FIFA World Cup so far. Costa Rica beat Italy and Uruguay and drew with England to top Group D, while an injury time penalty gave Greece a 2-1 victory over Côte d'Ivoire on Tuesday, sending them into the Round of 16. 
Despite Costa Rica's impressive victories, Tejeda insisted his side could not relax against the Greeks. 
"They are in the World Cup and they beat an excellent team, Ivory Coast," said the 22-year-old midfielder. "If they are there (in the Round of 16), it is because they were better." 
Tejeda said Costa Rica did not want to be the favourites against Greece in Sunday's game in Recife. He said: "We need to go step by step ... to have a clear mind."
