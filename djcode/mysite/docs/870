Ticos suffer Mora blow

The 29-year-old suffered the injury in a training session on Tuesday at their base in Santos. 
, who have called up Dave Myrie as a replacement, begin their campaign against Copa America champions Uruguay on Saturday. 
Myrie, 26, made his international debut in 2010 but has had a nomadic club career taking in 10 clubs in four different countries. 
The Costa Ricans, whose best performance at a World Cup was reaching the last 16 in 1990, also play Italy and England.
