Injury sends von Bergen home
Switzerland's Steve von Bergen will miss the rest of the FIFA World Cup™ after fracturing his left eye socket in the 5-2 defeat to France, the Swiss FA confirmed Saturday. 
The 31-year-old centre-back was accidentally kicked in the head by France striker Olivier Giroud after seven minutes of their Group E clash in Salvador on Friday and had to be helped off with a deep cut over his left eye. He was taken to hospital where a scan revealed the extent of the injury. 
"He will be repatriated as soon as possible to Switzerland, accompanied by Dr Roland Grossen," read a statement from the Swiss Federation. "He will then be cared for by specialists."
