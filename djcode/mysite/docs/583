Captain Muller propels Alexandria17 to prize
An immense defensive display, and having Thomas Muller as captain, propelled 
 to the top of the maiden McDonald’s FIFA World Cup™ Fantasy leaderboard – and won the Malaysian a fantastic prize.  
An adidas 2014 FIFA World Cup brazuca ball, a signed captain’s armband from a match Brazil 2014, and a PlayStation®3 copy of the EA SPORTS™ 2014 FIFA World Cup game are on their way to Alexandria17 and three of the coach’s four starting defenders – Pablo Armero, Serge Aurier and Ricardo Rodriguez – managed a highly impressive 14 points apiece. Juan Cuadrado and Neymar also dazzled for Alexandria17, and Muller, as skipper, got his 18-point haul doubled to leave the pacesetter on 154 points.  
 is second on 149, having benefitted from having Rafael Marquez, Jerome Boateng, Karim Benzema, Cuadrado, Neymar and Muller as skipper. The Mexican wins a Spain national team replica jersey and a PlayStation®3 copy of the EA SPORTS™ 2014 FIFA World Cup game. 


, 11 points off the pace in third, had a big haul from Germany defender Mats Hummels to thank for winning a PlayStation®3 copy of the EA SPORTS™ 2014 FIFA World Cup game. 




Alireza Haghighi (Iran)

The 26-year-old was expected to be a back-up goalkeeper for a country expected to leak goals. Yet Haghighi made a mockery of his £1m transfer fee by making four saves en route to a clean sheet against Nigeria and 11 points. What a bargain!  
Wilson Palacios (Honduras) 

Some considered £3.5m good value for the Stoke City midfielder. A conceded penalty, a booking and -1 points made those managers regret that decision.  
 Germany (125 points), Colombia (118), Chile (112) 

Germany thumped Portugal 4-0, with Muller, Hummels, Boateng and Mertesacker scoring heavily. 





Benzema will look to build on his two-goal showing against Honduras when France face Switzerland in Salvador, while Lionel Messi will fancy his chances of rippling the net against Iran.
