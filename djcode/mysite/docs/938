Altidore strikes as USA beat Nigeria
Jozy Altidore found some goalscoring form as USA beat Nigeria 2-1 last night in their final FIFA World Cup™ warm-up game on US soil before heading to Brazil. 
Sunderland’s much-maligned striker, who was without a goal in 2014, scored in each half as Jurgen Klinsmann’s side made it a hat-trick of wins after victories over Azerbaijan and Turkey. 
It was a fitting final dress rehearsal for the American squad and a confidence-boosting game for Altidore, who seems to have rediscovered his form at last. Except for a stumble late in the first half when they gave up a couple of scoring chances, the USA put together a complete performance against Nigeria, who are ranked 45th overall.  
Altidore opened the scoring in the 32nd minute, finishing from close range after a deft pass from Fabian Johnson. Altidore blasted a right-footed shot into the bottom left corner for his second goal in the 68th minute. Victor Moses scored the only goal for Nigeria with a penalty four minutes from time to make it 2-1.
