Kompany misses second training day
Belgium captain Vincent Kompany missed training for a second successive day with a groin problem, although coach Marc Wilmots said he expected him to be fully fit for their FIFA World Cup™ Group H match with Russia. 
The 28-year-old, who skippered Manchester City to the English Premier League title last season, felt a twinge in his groin towards the end of the 2-1 opening win over Algeria on Tuesday. 
"Vincent felt something in the final few minutes and was not able to sprint 100 per cent," said Wilmots. 
"He hoped that resting it overnight would resolve the problem, but it wasn't the case and on Wednesday morning he still had pain in the left groin. 
All being well, he will be back training with the rest of the squad on Saturday.

"We decided he would work alone from the rest of the squad for two days with the physiotherapist Lieven Maesschalk and the medical staff. All being well, he will be back training with the rest of the squad on Saturday." 
Wilmots, though, said there were plenty of replacements for Kompany if he did not recover in time.  
"If there is a problem with Vincent on Sunday there is always another solution," said 45-year-old Wilmots, who has the likes of Thomas Vermaelen, Laurent Ciman and Nicolas Lombaerts as alternatives. 
A win in the Maracana for the Belgians over the Russians, who drew 1-1 with Korea Republic in their opening game, would see the Red Devils reach the Round of 16 in what is their first major finals since the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
