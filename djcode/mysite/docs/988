Mirante to provide Italy cover
Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante will travel with Italy's World Cup squad to Brazil as a reserve, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) announced today. 
Italy are hoping to have second-choice goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu in top physical condition by the time the tournament starts in Brazil. 
Sirigu, who plays for Paris St Germain and started in Saturday's goalless draw against the Republic of Ireland in London, suffered a rib injury during training earlier this week. Doctors have ruled out a serious injury but the player will need several days to recover. 
A statement from the FIGC read: "Antonio Mirante will also be in tomorrow's charter flight that will take the Italian national team to Brazil. The Parma goalkeeper, who has taken part in all of the team's preparations in Coverciano, has been called up as a precautionary measure. 
"He will train with the team until June 13, the last day in which a team can replace any injured player according to the FIFA rules." 
Italy will start with Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon in goal. Genoa's Mattia Perin is the Azzurri's third-choice keeper. Mirante will join Inter Milan defender Andrea Ranocchia as Italy's reserve players. 
Italy travel to Brazil tomorrow and begin their World Cup campaign against England in Manaus on June 14.
