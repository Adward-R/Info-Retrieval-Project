Keeping the players cool at Brazil 2014
Official and mandatory cooling breaks have not been established for the 64 games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazilâ„¢, but instead they will be considered on a match-by-match basis.  
Climate conditions will be evaluated and should the temperature exceed 32 degrees, then the FIFA Venue Medical Office will recommend cooling breaks to the FIFA General Coordinator and Match Commissioner. The implementation of the cooling breaks will reside with the referee.  
Cooling breaks last three minutes in duration are then implemented by the referee at approximately 30 minutes into the run-of-play in both halves of the match (i.e. around the 30th minute and 75th minute respectively). Three minutes will then be added to stoppage time at the end of each half.
