Del Bosque hints at changes
Spain coach Vicente del Bosque hinted on Tuesday that he will make changes to his team for Wednesday's pivotal FIFA World Cup™ Group B clash against Chile in Rio de Janeiro. 
"We'll possibly make changes, but not a lot," Del Bosque told a press conference at the Maracanã, four days after his side opened their title defence with a chastening 5-1 loss to the Netherlands. "There are 12 players who haven't played, who have the level, who have the prestige, who play for great clubs in great championships, and maybe we'll give them the possibility (of playing)." 
Pedro Rodriguez, Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres are among the players who could be drafted into Spain's starting XI for Wednesday's game. Torres also appeared in front of the media at the Maracana on Tuesday, alongside Andres Iniesta, but when asked if it meant that the Chelsea striker would start against Chile, Del Bosque replied: "You'll have to ask the press officer why she put them up. She doesn't know the starting line-up." 
Del Bosque, who called for "a rebellion" from his players, must also decide whether to keep faith with captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who produced an error-strewn performance against Holland and pleaded for forgiveness from the Spanish public afterwards.
