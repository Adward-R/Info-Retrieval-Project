Hodgson has high hopes for Euro 2016
Roy Hodgson is confident that, despite England's two defeats at the FIFA World Cup™ bringing about an early exit, they have shown enough quality to raise hopes of a decent Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.  
 
"I believe England have a very strong basis for a team," he told newspaper reporters after his side's loss to Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday. 
 
"I have never doubted (that) this team as it moves forward - not just to 2016, but on from there - will become stronger and better. 
 

Among the players who played against Uruguay were 19-year-old Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling and 20-year-old Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, both of whom have been blooded by Hodgson. 
 
Given his side's relative inexperience, particularly when compared to a wily Uruguay team, Hodgson felt that England's display at the Corinthians Arena augured well. 
 
He added: "Results colour everyone's judgement and I am certainly happy with the way the players have prepared for these games. 
 
Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has confirmed that Hodgson will be allowed to see out his contract, which expires in 2016, and the former Liverpool manager received unequivocal backing from senior players Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart on Saturday.
