Vidal doubtful for Chile opener
Key midfielder Arturo Vidal remains an injury doubt for Chile ahead of their FIFA World Cup™ opener against Australia on 13 June in Cuiaba. 
The Juventus dead-ball specialist again did not train with his team-mates at their base in Belo Horizonte on Monday. Vidal, 28, has been struggling with inflammation in his knee since undergoing an operation on 7 May due to a meniscus problem. 
He made a surprise comeback in last Wednesday's 2-0 friendly victory over Northern Ireland, playing 15 minutes, but has not since been able to train with his team-mates. Tests carried out on Saturday revealed he had inflammation under his right kneecap. 
Vidal trained apart with some light jogging during the 15 minutes Chile's training session was open to the media, before kicking a ball, but only with his left foot. 
The rest of Chile's squad trained normally together, including Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez, despite suffering from a shoulder problem. 
Victory is crucial for Chile and Australia who are the two outsiders in Group B, which includes the finalists from South Africa four years ago, holders Spain and the Netherlands.
