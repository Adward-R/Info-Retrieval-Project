Puyol, Gisele to unveil Trophy prior to the Final 
In the minutes leading up to the kick-off of the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ Final, the FIFA World Cup Trophy will once again be unveiled. This year’s special guest primed to do the honours is Carles Puyol, one of the stand-out players of the Spain side that triumphed at the last edition at South Africa 2010.  
Alongside Puyol, who is considered a footballing idol both in his homeland and across the globe, will be Brazilian model and Louis Vuitton brand ambassador Gisele Bundchen. The duo will be charged with exciting fans at the Estadio Maracana on Sunday 13 July when the Trophy is displayed before the game, prior to being awarded to the next world champions later that evening in Rio de Janeiro.  
At the same time, the two teams contesting the Final will be making their final preparations for the big match, eager to take to the pitch and with the roar of the crowd ringing in their ears, while the coveted Trophy stands just a few steps away; so near and yet so far.  
The Trophy will continue to be housed in its tailor-made Louis Vuitton travel case, commissioned specifically for this purpose by FIFA in 2010. Prior to the title decider in South Africa the captain of Italy’s 2006 FIFA World Cup winning side, Fabio Cannavaro, took to the pitch to unveil the most recognisable prize in sport and the Trophy coveted by footballers everywhere, raising the levels of excitement ahead of the match. It will be no different this year, with Puyol, Bundchen and the Trophy sure to bring the Maracana crowd to its feet.
