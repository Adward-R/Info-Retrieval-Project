World Cup over for injured Mustafi
Shkodran Mustafi's is to miss the rest of the 2014 FIFA World Cupâ„¢ after the Germany defender tore muscle fibres in his left thigh during Monday's 2-1 win over Algeria. 
The Sampdoria central defender, who was in the starting XI deputising for Mats Hummels, who had the flu, had to leave the field in the 70th minute of the match to be replaced by Sami Khedira. Tests carried out on Monday evening confirmed the extent of his injury. 
"He's not going to play any further part in this World Cup," said Germany coach Joachim Low, who will now be keeping his fingers crossed that Hummels will recover in time to face France on Friday. 
Meanwhile, the cramp which forced Bastian Schweinsteiger to leave the field earlier than planned is not likely to jeopardise his chances of featuring against France. 
"It's nothing bad," said Low, who has rotated the Bayern Munich midfielder with Sami Khedira during the tournament so far.
