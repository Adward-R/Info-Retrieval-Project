5 days to go 
The legendary Velibor 'Bora' Milutinovic not only coached at five FIFA World Cups™ between 1986 and 2002, but did so with five different teams: Mexico, Costa Rica, USA, Nigeria and China PR.  
This latter feat was matched in 2010 by Carlos Alberto Parreira, who took charge of hosts South Africa in his sixth World Cup, having previously coached his native Brazil (twice), Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.  
Just behind this duo are the five men who coached at four different World Cups: Josef 'Sepp' Herberger (Germany FR), his successor Helmut Schon, Walter Winterbottom (England), Lajos Baroti (Hungary) and Henri Michel (France, Morocco, Cameroon and Côte d’Ivoire).
