Marin: Costa Rica must score first
Costa Rica are determined to score first when they face Greece in the FIFA World Cup™ Round of 16 in Recife on Sunday.  
The Greeks have developed a reputation over the years of being extremely hard to break down, particularly if they take the lead, and 
 technical assistant Luis Marin said his team need to score early to prevent their opponents from going in front. 
"It's crucial for us to score early in the game, especially as Greece are known to tighten up at the back once they score," said Marin. 
"But we know it's going to be a tough game all round. Although they lost to Colombia 3-0, the goals they conceded were down to simple mistakes. Greece are also potent on the counter-attack." 
We've been practicing shooting from the penalty spot.

He added: "Penalties could play a role at some point. They are a part of the game and although we hope it doesn't happen, we have to prepare for every scenario. We've been practicing shooting from the penalty spot." 
Costa Rica emerged as one of the form teams of the group stages, stunning Uruguay and then Italy before drawing with England to finish top of Group D. 
As well as their potent attack, Costa Rica can boast a tight defence, having conceded just once, to an Edinson Cavani penalty during their 3-1 defeat of Uruguay, in the tournament so far. 
"If we have a good point, it's our defensive system, which isn't just the four or five defenders," said coach Jorge Luis Pinto. "Our defence is balanced, tough and very efficient."
