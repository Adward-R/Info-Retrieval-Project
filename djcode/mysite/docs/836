De Sciglio to miss Italy's opener
Italy have confirmed defender Mattia De Sciglio will not feature in their FIFA World Cup™ opener against England on Saturday because of an injury. The AC Milan player was hurt during Thursday's training session and was taken to a nearby hospital to have an MRI. 
"Defender Mattia De Sciglio, after today's (Thursday) training session in Portobello, has sustained a muscle strain in his left thigh," Italy team doctor Enrico Castellacci said. 
"The player underwent an MRI this afternoon at Angra dos Reis and the test has revealed an oedema in his left femoral biceps. De Sciglio will not be available for the first game against England." 
Italy coach Cesare Prandelli is unlikely to replace De Sciglio, despite having taken Inter Milan defender Andrea Ranocchia as a reserve player to Brazil. The 
can make a substitution because of an injury 24 hours prior to their World Cup debut. 
De Sciglio has been ruled out for the Group D opener but is expected to recover in time for the clash with Costa Rica on June 20. Prandelli will have the rest of his players available after Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti recovered from flu. 
The Italians travel to Manaus on Friday morning and will train at the Amazonia Arena later that day, the venue for Saturday's encounter.
