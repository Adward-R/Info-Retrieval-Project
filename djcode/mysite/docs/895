2 days to go 
Just two men have won the FIFA World Cup™ as both player and coach: Mario Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer.  
Zagallo won the Trophy twice during his playing career, in 1958 and 1962, and was then in charge of the Brazil team that recaptured the title at Mexico 1970.  
Beckenbauer's triumphs came in 1974 and 1990 respectively, and he was also a losing finalist in 1966 as a player and 1986 as a coach.
