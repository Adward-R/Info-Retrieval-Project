Hodgson: Welbeck fit to face Italy
England manager Roy Hodgson has revealed that Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy in their opening FIFA World Cup Group D game against Italy in Manaus on Saturday. 
"Danny's fit," Hodgson said in his pre-match press conference at the Amazonia Arena. "I'm very fortunate that even after four weeks of preparation, the only player who isn't available for selection is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. That we knew, so there can be no complaints on that score."

British newspapers reported on Tuesday that Manchester United forward Welbeck had been forced out of a closed training session with a thigh injury and he did not train with the squad on Wednesday. Arsenal midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain is working his way back to fitness after damaging knee ligaments in a friendly against Ecuador.
