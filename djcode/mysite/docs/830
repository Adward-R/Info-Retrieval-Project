Forlan back in training after illness
Veteran Uruguay striker Diego Forlan was back in training on Thursday following a stomach bug that kept him off the practice pitch the day before. The 35-year-old had stayed in the gym and missed both Uruguay training sessions on Wednesday after waking up with a "digestive problem", the team's press office had said. 
The former Manchester United and Inter Milan forward, who picked up the Golden Ball award for best player of the tournament the last FIFA World Cup™ took part in stretching exercises alongside his team-mates during the 15 minutes training at the Sete Lagoas stadium was open to the media. 
Fellow striker Luis Suarez, who finished top scorer in the English Premier League with Liverpool, also trained but is not expected to be fit for Saturday's Group D opener against Costa Rica in Fortaleza. 
Suarez, 27, is struggling to recover from a knee operation he underwent on May 22 for a meniscus problem. Should Suarez miss out, Forlan's participation would be essential alongside Paris Saint-Germain's record signing Edinson Cavani. 
Another player who trained normally for Uruguay on Thursday was veteran centre-back Diego Lugano, who had also been struggling with an injury. It was the last training session before Oscar Tabarez's team were due to travel to Fortaleza later on Thursday.
