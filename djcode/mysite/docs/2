Schweinsteiger hungry for more trophies
Bastian Schweinsteiger is targeting further glory with Germany after finally winning his first major trophy with the national side. Ever since he made his international debut in 2004, Schweinsteiger had become used to just coming up short in major tournaments. 
Of the five he played in prior to Brazil, Schweinsteiger reached the semi-finals on three occasions and at UEFA Euro 2008, he was part of the Germany team that lost to Spain. All that changed on Sunday night, however, when he and his team-mates beat Argentina 1-0 to win the FIFA World Cup™ at the Maracana. 
Schweinsteiger does not want this to be the last time he lifts a trophy though. With a young squad in place, he feels there is plenty of potential there for Germany to go on and win many trophies in the near future. 
We are the first European team to win the title in South America...so it has been special.
Bastian Schweinsteiger on Germany's World Cup success
"This will give us hunger now, absolutely," the midfielder said. "We want to do it again at the next tournament. The important thing is that the young guys have the experience of this tournament and we will go to France (for Euro 2016) and try and do it again for sure. 
"It won't be easy because we have a young team. But we have some players like Philipp Lahm, Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker who have the experience. This mix makes a big difference." 
No European nation had previously lifted the famous trophy on South American soil in four attempts. So Schweinsteiger was understandably proud of his team-mates for writing history in Rio. 
"We are the first European team to win the title in South America, the first team from Europe so it has been special," the 29-year-old added.
