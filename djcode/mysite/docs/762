Modric back to training after foot scan
Croatia playmaker Luka Modric should be fit to resume training after being given the all-clear following a foot problem, the Croatian Football Federation said today. 
The 28-year-old Real Madrid star suffered a blow to his foot during Thursday's FIFA World Cup™ Opening Match, a 3-1 defeat by Brazil at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo. 
"Luka felt pain after receiving a blow against Brazil," said the CFF. "He underwent an MRI scan which revealed there was no break nor damage to ligaments." 
Modric has since returned to Croatia's Mata de Sao Joao base camp near Salvador and is due to resume training. 
Croatia next play Cameroon, who also lost their opening match, 1-0 to Mexico, in Manaus on Wednesday before ending their Group A campaign against 
 in Recife on 23 June.
