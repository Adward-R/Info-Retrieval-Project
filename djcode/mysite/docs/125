Yokohama revenge not an issue for Boateng
Defender Jerome Boateng insists Germany will not be hunting revenge against Brazil for their defeat in the 2002 Final during Tuesday's FIFA World Cupâ„¢ semi-final. 
Ronaldo scored twice in Brazil's 2-0 win over the Germans in the 2002 Final, but 12 years after Yokohama, a place in Sunday's Final is all the motivation the Germans need for the Belo Horizonte semi, says Boateng. 
After Friday's quarter-final win over France set up a showdown with the 
, German FA (DFB) president Wolfgang Niersbach reminded the team they had "a result to correct" against Brazil. 
But Boateng said the Germans only want a place in Sunday's Final at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium. "There is certainly no revenge, we just want to make it to Final," said Germany centre-back Boateng. 
"The whole stadium will be against us, which I guess it should be an additional motivation. We will have a huge test in front of us. 
"We have to go into the match with full concentration and impose our way of playing. I am highly motivated, I can't wait to play the game." 
Brazil will be without injured superstar Neymar and suspended captain Thiago Silva against Germany, but Boateng said he would relish taking on Bayern team-mate Dante. The 30-year-old is set to replace Silva at centre-back.  
"I think if he plays it will be an advantage for both teams, we are looking forward to having Dante on the pitch, it will be unusual to see him on the other side," said Boateng.
