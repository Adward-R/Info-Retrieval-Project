Referee designations for matches 51 and 52
FIFA has announced the referees for the FIFA World Cup™ matches 51 and 52. 



Netherlands-Mexico will be officiated by Pedro Proenca from Portugal, who refereed Cameroon-Croatia and Japan-Colombia in the group stage. The 43-year-old was selected to oversee two prestigious European finals in 2012, namely Bayern Munich-Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League and Spain-Italy in the UEFA European Championship. Last year, Proenca was included on the roster of referees for the FIFA Confederations Cup, where he oversaw two opening-round matches. During Brazil 2014 qualifying, Proenca took charge of Greece-Romania in the play-offs. 



The second match on Sunday, 29 June between Costa Rica and Greece will be officiated by Benjamin Williams. It will be the third World Cup match for the 37-year-old Australian, following Honduras-Ecuador and Korea Republic-Belgium. Williams has previously been selected for the Men's Olympic Football Tournament in 2012 and the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2013. He has overseen two Champions League finals in two different confederations, namely Waitakere United-Kossa FC in the OFC in 2007 and Ulsan-Al Ahli in the AFC in 2012.
