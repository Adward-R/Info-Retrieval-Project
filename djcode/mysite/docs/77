Julio Cesar accepts Brazil career is over
Goalkeeper Julio Cesar accepted on Saturday that his international career is finished after Brazil's FIFA World Cup campaign ended in disappointment. 
 
"To play at the Copa America in 2015, at the age of 35, would be quite complicated. To go there without having the 2018 World Cup in mind would be selfish on my part."
