Felipão unruffled by Hulk condition
Hulk not being fit to play in Brazil's second FIFA World Cup™ Group A game, against Mexico, would not be the end of the world according to coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.
 
A leg muscle problem means the Zenit St Petersburg forward, who started the Opening Match 3-1 win over Croatia, is doubtful as the hosts look to cement their position atop the group by beating 
. 
"We'll see how things transpire and decide before the match," said Scolari. 
Asked about Hulk missing training, 
 batted the question away. "He didn't come as he'd have done nothing here," said the 65-year-old. 
"He wouldn't have run, wouldn't have participated. There was no need for him to come so he stayed behind and had treatment.  
"I can choose a replacement with my eyes closed - there will be no problem. I have 23 players and I think I've selected them well. 
"I have players with different characteristics and different qualities to Hulk who can bolster the team."
