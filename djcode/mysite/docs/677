Buffon returns to training
Gianluigi Buffon was back in FIFA World Cup™ training on Tuesday but Italy would not say whether or not he will be fit to face Costa Rica on Friday. 
The 36-year-old Juventus shot-stopper seemed to be training normally, diving on the ball, but 
 coach Cesare Prandelli may yet decide to hold him back until the final Group D clash with Uruguay on 24 June, to give the 2006 World Cup winner more time to fully recover. Buffon had to pull out of Saturday's 2-1 win over England due to an ankle sprain, with Paris Saint-Germain's Salvatore Sirigu filling the void between the sticks. 
Centre-back Andrea Barzagli and midfielder Daniele De Rossi, both of whom sat out Monday's training, were back in action on Tuesday. Full-back Mattia De Sciglio, who was ruled out of the England match due to a muscle problem, also trained.
