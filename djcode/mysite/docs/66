Schweinsteiger: We're under no pressure
Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said on Saturday that his side will be under "no pressure" when they tackle Argentina in Sunday's FIFA World Cup™ Final at the Maracana. 
Schweinsteiger told a press conference at the iconic Rio de Janeiro stadium: "We're looking forward to it. There's huge anticipation and joy. We have no pressure." 
Striker Miroslav Klose is the only survivor in the Germany squad from the team that was beaten 2-0 by Brazil in the 2002 World Cup Final, but Schweinsteiger insists that his team-mates have sufficient experience of major games. 
"We have lots of players among the 23 who've played in important finals and we know how to handle that," he said. 
We're looking forward to it. There's huge anticipation and joy. We have no pressure.

"We have Miroslav Klose, who played in the final in 2002. Other players have played in finals with their clubs and have produced outstanding performances. 
"We just have to think about the job we have to do. When the referee blows his whistle, we just have to concentrate on what makes us strong. 
"Everything else around the game, we can take it in, but we have to keep it at a distance. Your head must be clear and concentrating only on football." 
Germany are bidding to win their first World Cup since 1990, when a team managed by former captain Franz Beckenbauer beat Argentina 1-0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.
