ASF statement
The FC Zurich forward's foot got stuck in the turf when he fell badly. A scan revealed he had torn his cruciate ligament. He will now go back to Switzerland for an operation. The 24-year-old, who has 11 caps, is unlikely to play again in 2014, the ASF said. 
Switzerland play in the last 16 clash against Lionel Messi's Argentina in Sao Paulo on Tuesday.
