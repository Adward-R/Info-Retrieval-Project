Torres: Win more crucial than style
Fernando Torres said on Tuesday that Spain are prepared to abandon their attractive playing style as they look to resurrect their FIFA World Cup™ title defence against Chile on Wednesday. 
"The important thing is that we win, hopefully in our usual style, at the high level that allowed us to win the World Cup and [UEFA] Euro 2012," the Chelsea striker told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday. "And if we can't win like that, we have to win anyway, because otherwise we'll have to go back home. All that's important tomorrow (Wednesday) is that Spain play and win." 
Playing their characteristic 
 possession football, Spain have won the last three major tournaments that they have qualified for, but they were humiliated 5-1 by the Netherlands in their opening Group B game on Friday. 
If Vicente del Bosque's side lose to Chile on Wednesday and Louis Van Gaal's Netherlands avoid defeat against Australia, Spain will be out, but Torres says that the squad are only thinking about victory. "I think that nobody who's going to play thinks about losing," he said. 
"We all think about winning. Of course a defeat's one of three possibilities, but that's not what we're considering. We don't want to think about that possibility. We know Chile are very dangerous opponents and are going to try to win. 
"That's a problem because they're not going to sit back; they're going to be attacking. We know that they have maybe more problems in defence, but we want to win against Chile and after we'll think about the next game. Since we lost against the Netherlands, the only thing we've thought about is winning against Chile."
