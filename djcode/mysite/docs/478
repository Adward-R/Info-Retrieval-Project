USA's Altidore ruled out for Germany game
USA striker Jozy Altidore will miss this week's final group match with Germany but remains hopeful of returning from injury to play again in this FIFA World Cup™, coach Jurgen Klinsmann has said. The 24-year-old pulled up painfully during USA's win over Ghana on 16 June, but Klinsmann said he hoped to have him back, should USA qualify for the knock-out stages. 
"Jozy is recovering really well, he's doing a tremendous job and our medical staff is on top of it. This game comes still too early for him," Klinsmann said. "But we're working on him, we'll get him back in this tournament as we said. So once this game hopefully is done successfully we'll have a good chance to have him back in the team."

Qualification is not assured for USA, who are second on goal difference in Group G behind Germany. Ghana and Portugal are both three points behind meaning that a draw in either final group game would see USA through. Klinsmann said the rest of his team were fit and recovered from the 2-2 draw against Portugal as they prepare to take on Germany in Recife on Thursday. 
"Everybody else is on board, is fit, is hungry, is willing to get that last result in order to qualify for the knock-out round," he said.
