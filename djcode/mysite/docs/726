Italy hopeful over Buffon return
Italy are hopeful that goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defender Mattia De Sciglio will recover in time for Friday's Group D match against Costa Rica. Both players missed the Azzurri's 2-1 triumph over England on Saturday with injuries. 
Buffon twisted his left ankle last Friday and was replaced by Salvatore Sirigu in goal. "Gigi (Buffon) has had a specific trauma, which is not your usual sprained ankle," Italy's team doctor Enrico Castellacci said. "It has affected the knee but fortunately, the knee ligament is fine. 
"His condition will be evaluated. He is having specific therapy and we will decide whether or not to do some X-rays. We will try to have him available as soon as possible. We are optimistic that he will have a speedy recovery but his health comes first.

"I cannot say if he will be able to make it for the game against Costa Rica. After the injury, Buffon told me he was relieved because for a moment he feared he may have to miss the World Cup." 
De Sciglio, meanwhile, has a calf strain. "There is no date yet for his return," Castellacci said. "Right now he is not in a condition to train with the rest of the squad because you cannot take risks when dealing with muscular injuries. Mattia was also concerned he might miss the World Cup but once he was reassured that he could play in Brazil, he smiled again."
