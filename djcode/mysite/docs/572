What if…?
With the group stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ entering its decisive phase, some teams have already started packing their bags for home while others are busy preparing for the Round of 16.



With that in mind and in order for you to be well-equipped ahead of the crunch encounters,
 has rounded up all the rules and permutations.




The top two teams in each group qualify for the Round of 16.



The final standings are calculated thus:

1) Total number of points earned in all group matches.

2) Goal difference from all group matches.

3) Total number of goals scored in all group matches.



If two or more teams remain level after the above criteria have been applied, their position in the table will be determined by the following factors:

4) Points earned in the head-to-head group matches between the tied teams.

5) Goal difference from the head-to-head group matches between the tied teams.

6) Number of goals scored in the head-to-head group matches between the tied teams.



If there is still a tie after all of the above have been taken into consideration then the FIFA Organising Committee will settle the matter by a drawing of lots. 




Single yellow cards are to be cancelled after the quarter-finals. This is to avoid the scenario where a player is suspended for a second yellow card he received in the semi-finals, for the final.
 
If a player receives two yellow cards in two different games for his team, he is automatically suspended for the next game. 
If a player receives a red or an indirect red card, that player will be automatically suspended for the next game.  
In addition, further sanctions by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee may be imposed in case of a direct red card.
