Pogba: No words for that moment
France midfielder Paul Pogba hailed his crucial goal as one of the best moments of his life as 
swept into the FIFA World Cup™ quarter-finals after beating Nigeria 2-0 in Brasilia. 
Pogba's header came in the 79th minute and Joseph Yobo's own goal put the gloss on a hard-fought victory for Didier Deschamps' side. 
The 21-year-old said: "I have no words to describe this feeling. The whole country is behind us and scoring that goal really liberated us. I am so happy for the team and all of France. 
"To score a goal for your country, especially in such an important game as this, to get into the last eight of the World Cup, is one of the best moments of my life." 
Deschamps said he was "very proud" of his side but admitted that France had suffered from the tension. He said: "We're in the quarter-finals now and we will do everything we can to go one step further."
