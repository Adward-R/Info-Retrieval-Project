 lost their first game against Costa Rica 3-1 while the Three Lions were defeated 2-1 by Italy. 
"We did not play badly in the first game," Tabarez said. "But we were hurt by the Costa Rica goals. We could not impose our strategy on the game." 
 

The coach said he has not yet chosen the team to confront England, although Liverpool striker Suarez, who had an operation to repair a damaged meniscus barely three weeks ago, is said to be fit again. 
Suarez warmed up on the touchline at one stage during the encounter with Costa Rica, but Tabarez did not risk him.

The South Americans will be forced to replace Maximiliano Pereira, though, who was sent off at the end of the Costa Rica game.
