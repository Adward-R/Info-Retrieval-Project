4 days to go 
In the history of the FIFA World Cup™, only two players have scored in four different editions - and both did so between 1958 and 1970.  
The first member of this duo is perhaps obvious, with Pele the outstanding player of the era and arguably the star man at both the '58 and '70 editions.  
The second, though, is a legend very much in his own right, and Germany's Uwe Seeler not only beat Pele to become the first to reach this particular milestone, but is also the only player to have scored twice or more in four separate World Cups.
