Pekerman drafts Carbonero into squad
Colombia coach Jose Pekerman has handed a surprise call-up to midfielder Carlos Carbonero ahead of their 2014 FIFA World Cup™ campaign.
 
The 23-year-old, who plays for River Plate in Argentina, has been drafted into the squad as a replacement for Aldo Leao Ramirez, who will miss the tournament in Brazil after suffering an injury in Friday's friendly win against Jordan.  
Carbonero's inclusion is unexpected as he has not featured for Colombia since Pekerman took charge in January 2012. 
The midfielder is the third River Plate player in Colombia's squad, joining club team-mates Eder Alvarez-Balanta and striker Teofilo Gutierrez.  
The South Americans face Greece, Côte d’Ivoire and Japan in Group C at Brazil 2014.
