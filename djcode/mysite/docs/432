Referee designations for matches 45-48
FIFA has announced the referees for FIFA World Cup™ matches 45 to 48, the final fixtures in the preliminary round for Group G and Group H. 
USA against Germany will be the deciding match to win Group G, and it will be overseen by Ravshan Irmatov, the only Uzbek referee to have officiated at the finals of a FIFA tournament to date. Irmatov is 36 years old and refereed five matches at the 2010 FIFA World Cup including the Opening Match, the Argentina-Germany quarter-final, and a semi-final. At Brazil 2014, he has already taken charge of the Switzerland-Ecuador and Croatia-Mexico encounters. 
Match 46, Portugal-Ghana, will also be refereed by an Asian referee, namely Nawaf Shukralla from Bahrain. The first FIFA competition for the 37-year-old was the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2011, followed by the FIFA Club World Cup 2012 and the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2013. In the same year, he officiated the second leg of the AFC Champions League final, and so far at the 2014 FIFA World Cup he has refereed the Australia-Spain game.  
Korea Republic against Belgium will be officiated by Benjamin Williams, who is Australian and 37 years old. He has been overseeing international matches since 2005 and was in charge of two matches at both the Olympic Football Tournament 2012 and the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2013, where he led the quarter-final meeting between Iraq and Korea Republic. A few days ago, Williams refereed the match between Honduras and Ecuador in Curitiba. 
The same city will play host to Match 48, Algeria-Russia, which will be refereed by Cuneyt Çakir. It will be the second game for the 37-year-old Turkish referee after Brazil against Mexico. Çakir has already seen action at several major competitions such as UEFA EURO 2012 and the FIFA Club World Cup 2012 as well as the FIFA U-20 World Cup in both 2011 and 2013. Last year, he also handled Ukraine-France in the FIFA World Cup preliminary play-offs.
