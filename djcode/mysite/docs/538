Referee designations for matches 33-36 
FIFA has announced the referees for the FIFA World Cup™ matches 33 to 36, the final matches in the preliminary round for Groups A and B.  
Proceedings in the match Cameroon v. Brazil will be overseen by Jonas Eriksson, the 40-year-old referee from Sweden. He has already refereed the Group G match between Ghana and the USA in this competition. In previous years, Eriksson has overseen two matches at UEFA EURO 2012 and in the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ qualifying stages he was selected to referee the second leg of the CONMEBOL/AFC play-off.  
The other match in Group A, Croatia v. Mexico, will kick off simultaneously. It will be officiated by Ravshan Irmatov, 36 years old and the first Uzbek national to referee at the finals of a FIFA tournament to date. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup™, he refereed five matches, including the opening match between South Africa and Mexico, Argentina v. Germany in the quarter-finals and the semi-final encounter between Uruguay and the Netherlands. Earlier in the 2014 FIFA World Cup™, Irmatov took charge of the match Switzerland v. Ecuador.  
The match Australia v. Spain – the last for both teams in this competition – will be refereed by Nawaf Shukralla who is 37 years old and from Bahrain. For Shukralla it will be the first match of the tournament. He was selected for his first FIFA competition in 2011, the U-17 World Cup. Since then he has handled games at the FIFA Club World Cup 2012 and the U-20 World Cup 2013.  
Match 36 will be the decider in Group B. The Netherlands and Chile both won their first two matches and will be vying for first place. The game will be overseen by Bakary Gassama, 35 years old and the first referee from the Gambia to appear in the FIFA World Cup™. It will be the tournament debut for Gassama, who officiated two matches at the Olympic Football Tournament 2012 and can also list games at the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2013 and the FIFA Club World Cup 2013 on his CV.
