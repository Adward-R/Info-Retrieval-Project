Lahm: This feeling is unbelievable
Germany captain Philipp Lahm hailed his side's collective ability after they downed Lionel Messi's Argentina 1-0 to win the FIFA World Cup™ for a fourth time in Rio de Janeiro.
 
Substitute Mario Gotze grabbed the only goal of the game in extra time as 
 paid the price for missing a host of good chances through Gonzalo Higuain, Messi and Rodrigo Palacio. 
"It's unbelievable what we have achieved," said the Bayern Munich defender. "We improved throughout the tournament and didn't get down when things didn't always go our way. 
"We just stuck to our path and at the end we're standing here as world champions. It's an unbelievable feeling. The team stayed calm and patient, we knew that we had something left at the end."
