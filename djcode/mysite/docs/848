Guide for fans attending Brazil 2014 matches
The 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ has generated unprecedented demand for tickets and now fans from all over the globe are enjoying goals galore in sport's biggest competition, which, 64 years on from first being held in Brazil, is back to the only nation that has won the world title on five occasions.   However, an event of this magnitude requires a series of measures that ensure each fan’s experience is as safe and enjoyable as possible. With that aim in mind, so that nothing can go wrong when it comes to fully savouring this unforgettable experience, it is wise to take on board certain hints and tips.  

The gates will be opened three hours before kick-off - with the exception of the Opening Game and Final Match which open 4 hours before - so make sure you know how to make your way to the stadium and try to arrive with this amount of time in advance. This way it’ll be swifter and smoother for you to locate your seat and, what is more, there will be no shortage of things to enjoy while you are waiting for the ball to start rolling.  
As a contribution to mobility and to ensure an enjoyable experience for fans during the 30 days of competition, Liberty Seguros will offer in the twelve FIFA World Cup stadiums a shuttle service for people with limited mobility, elderly, pregnant women and people with children. The transfer will be made by electric carts that will make the route from the parking lots to the stadium entrances. 



Each of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ stadiums features a “Fan Zone”. The Fan Zones feature a number of engaging displays and activities provided by FIFA and our Commercial Affiliates which will entertain you and your family and friends in the hours leading up to kick-off. In addition to this we provide refreshment stations, beer gardens and even a barbecue area where you can relax and soak up the atmosphere before heading to your seat. Besides, you can visit the super stores – the best place to purchase exclusive licensed FIFA World Cup products.  
In order to speed up your shopping experience, make sure you pay in cash or with your Visa card. Itaú clients may withdraw money from the ATMs located within the Fan Zone and the premises of each stadium. Other banks’ clients may look for the Visa booths and purchase a pre-paid Visa card – either by credit or debit card, both Brazilian and international ones. Those special FIFA World Cup prepaid cards can be charged only once with a minimum value of R$20,00 and a maximum of R$1.500,00. They are for exclusive use inside Brazil and valid for just one year from the date of issuance. A valid passport is required for purchase. 



It is important to note that - with the exception of the Arena da Baixada in Curitiba, the Arena Pantanal in Cuiaba, the Arena Amazonia in Manaus and the Arena de Sao Paulo -, the Fan Zone is located before the stadiums’ turnstiles, hence it is not possible to access it once you have gone through them. 



Arrive early, look for your assigned seat and remember that, for security reasons, everybody – even babies under two years of age – must have a ticket in order to enter a stadium. Supporters who have bought special category tickets, such as the elderly, people with disabilities and recipients of Bolsa-Familia (Family Allowance), should bring documentation confirming their eligibility for such tickets. Other supporters should carry an identification document in case a problem arises with their ticket at the turnstiles. In this situation, the supporter should go to the Troubleshooting Centre located next to the turnstile, and present his or her identification document so that a new ticket can be printed.  Seats in the stadium are numbered. In the event that someone is seated in the place of a supporter and refuses to leave, the supporter should seek assistance from the closest Spectator Services volunteer, and then, if necessary, a steward. For further information, check the Stadium Code of Conduct for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™.  
  

It is important to remember that supporters will be required to pass through metal detectors on their way into the Arena. Ideally, fans should not bring bags or backpacks to the stadium, in order not to cause queuing delays. When it comes to entering the stadium, a rigorous search process will be in place, in order to guarantee the safety of all in attendance. For this reason, the following items will not be permitted to be brought into the stadium: 

• Weapons of any kind 

• Bottles, cups, mugs or cans 

• Musical instruments 

• Fireworks or flares of any kind 

• Umbrellas 

• Helmets 

• Cans containing sprays or inflammable substances 

• Food or drinks of any kind 

• Equipment for broadcasting sound, images or match results 

• Chemical or narcotic substances 

• Advertising or promotional materials of any kind 

• Powder, flour or similar substances 

• Large quantities or rolls of paper 

• Megaphones, sirens or gas-powered horns

Please read these instructions carefully, look to avoid problems and, above all, have a great time.
