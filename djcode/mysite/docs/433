Queiroz: Bosnia game is our World Cup final
Iran coach Carlos Queiroz says Wednesday's clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina is effectively their World Cup final as they try to keep alive hopes of reaching the knockout stages. Iran must beat Bosnia and hope Nigeria fail to pick up a point against Argentina in the other Group F match, though the Iranians progress to the knock-out stages could come down to goal difference. 
Nevertheless, Queiroz said his side is just focused on a good performance in their final group game. "This is our World Cup final, it's as simple as that," said the 61-year-old Portuguese.  
"We didn't come here to win the trophy, nobody expected that from Iran, but we raised our expectations and we raised our dreams. We want to play the match with one goal in mind - to fulfil our dream of reaching the last 16."

Having failed to score in their goalless draw with Nigeria and the 1-0 defeat to Argentina, settled by a late Lionel Messi strike, Queiroz's side must score in Salvador. He said he will be keeping one eye on Nigeria's match against Argentina in Porto Alegre, hoping the Africans do not pull off an upset. 
"I have nothing against the Nigerians, I'm African myself, but with all due respect, Argentina's victory would put us in a better position," said Mozambique-born Queiroz. "I have spoken to my players and we have to focus on our job, all the rest is in the hands of God."
