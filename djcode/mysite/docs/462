Suarez targets Italian weaknesses
Luis Suarez has explained how Uruguay will attempt to pounce on opposition weaknesses as 
 bid to keep their FIFA World Cupâ„¢ dream alive with a win against Italy in Natal on Tuesday.
 
The Liverpool striker helped his country recover from their 3-1 opening match defeat against Costa Rica by scoring a brace in a morale-boosting 2-1 win over England last week. 
Coupled with the Italians' shock loss to Costa Rica, who have already qualified for the Round of 16, the result gave the two-time champions hope of emulating their impressive 2010 campaign, which ended at the semi-final stage. 
Italy require only a draw to secure qualification to the knockouts, and although Suarez expects a tough encounter against Cesare Prandelli's side, he believes Uruguay will rise to the challenge. 
"From last year's Confederations Cup, I know how organised they are. If you leave them just an inch they will make you pay," the 27-year-old said. 
"But they have weaknesses as well as strengths, and we will try to exploit those weaknesses. We expect Italy to be tough opponents, but we know what's at stake and we are going out there to qualify." 

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez, who coached AC Milan during a spell in the 1990s, is more than familiar with the Italian game, and the 67-year-old said the prospect of beating 
 is a huge motivation. 
"For me it would not be like winning any other match. The prospect of beating one of the best teams in the world is a huge motivation for me," he commented. 
"But we know it's decisive. We will go home or we will stay. Earlier in the competition we depended on the results of others. Now, the task is clear. If we win we're through, and we're ready to rise to the challenge."
