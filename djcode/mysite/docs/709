Low: What makes Muller so dangerous
Germany coach Joachim Low poured praise on makeshift striker Thomas Muller after his hat-trick in today's 4-0 rout of Portugal at the FIFA World Cupâ„¢, but also hinted at making changes.
 
The three-time tournament winners became the first country to reach the milestone of 100 FIFA World Cup matches and marked the occasion by thumping their Cristiano Ronaldo-led opponents. 
Muller bagged the Germans' seventh FIFA World Cup treble in total - more than any other nation, with Argentina second on four. 
"Thomas did really well up front and he constantly tore holes in the defence," enthused Low after the Group G clash. 
"He is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is: 'How can I score a goal?' That makes him so dangerous, especially in the box." 
A decisive first half allowed Germany to race into a 3-0 lead in Salvador as Muller converted a penalty, then fired home their third on the stroke of half-time after Mats Hummels scored with a header. 
Muller, who normally plays as a winger or attacking midfielder for Bayern Munich, wrapped up his hat-trick with a scrappy effort in the closing stages. 
"The whole team played incredibly compactly and hardly gave away any chances to counter attack," added Low. 
"When we went 3-0 up, it was important to hold the ball and play more economically. Jerome Boateng did really well against Ronaldo." 

Ghana await the Germans next in Fortaleza on 21 June; Hummels is an injury concern after being helped off with a thigh problem and Low will weigh up his options over the next few days. 
"We will now look at the team set-up," he said. "Ghana has an incredible physique, they are very robust, with very fast players. 
"The heat conditions will demand a lot of us. Mats Hummels had a knock to the thigh, but I assume that it wasn't too serious."
