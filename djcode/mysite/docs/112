New CBF President backs Scolari
Luiz Felipe Scolari looks set to keep his job despite Brazil's humbling in the World Cup semi-final against Germany. Brazil's 200-million strong population was hoping to cheer the country in the World Cup final this weekend, but must instead watch them fight for third place against the Netherlands. 
Scolari's team bowed out of their own World Cup on Tuesday when they were demolished 7-1. But the president elect of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) believes 'Felipao' should remain in his post. "To me, he stays," Marco Polo Del Nero, told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.  
"What happened was a tactical error. That was the problem. But we all make mistakes. It can happen to anyone. The important thing is that he did a good job. The campaign and the preparations were good. A base exists." 
Scolari will meet Del Nero and the current president of the CBF, Jose Maria Marin, following the match in Brasilia. Scolari said he had no idea whether the words of the president in waiting, who takes over next April, meant he would definitely stay on. "The first phase of my job finishes on Saturday," Scolari told a press conference in Brasilia on the eve of the match.  
"After that I will prepare my report and then I will talk with the presidents. They will look at what was right and what was wrong in what I did, but I know in the last year and a half we had several good situations. We have to be ashamed of the 7-1. It was a catastrophe, but I have to ask the media - is everything bad because of one result?"Â
