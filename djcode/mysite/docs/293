Low has security for the long term
Joachim Low has been assured that he will remain in charge of Germany no matter what unfolds in the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ knockout stages.
 
The coach extended his contract until 2016 prior to the FIFA World Cup, with no conditions attached. After reaching at least the semi-finals in three tournaments under Low's command, expectation levels are high in Germany and anything less than that again will be deemed a failure. 
"We still have the clear intention of carrying on with him," the German Football Association president, Wolfgang Niersbach, told 
 magazine. "There are no clauses in his contract which state that it depends on certain results." 
Germany take on Algeria in the Round of 16 on Monday and could face a showdown with European rivals France in the quarter-finals at Brazil 2014. 
"The way we have developed has been fantastic," said Niersbach. "Previously, we were getting recognition for our results while now we're getting a great degree of recognition for our style of play."
