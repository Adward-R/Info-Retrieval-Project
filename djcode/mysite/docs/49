Fred retires from Brazil duty
Brazil striker Fred announced his retirement from international football on Sunday, one day after Brazil ended their 2014 FIFA World Cup™ campaign. 
 "For me, the 
 is finished," the 30-year-old Fluminense forward told the 
 newspaper. 
Fred scored one goal at Brazil 2014 and made his last appearance during Tuesday's 7-1 semi-final loss against Germany in Belo Horizonte. The former Lyon forward made his Brazil debut in 2005 and went on to score 39 international goals.
