Muller: It's about more than goals
Germany forward Thomas Muller says there is only one trophy he wants to take back home with him this summer - and it is not the Golden Boot. 
The 24-year-old finished joint-top goalscorer at the FIFA World Cup™ four years ago, and with his hat-trick in the first group game against Portugal, is in the running for a repeat performance in Brazil. 
However, the Bayern Munich player has said that the number of goals he scores personally does not matter in the grand scheme of things. 
"I won the Golden Boot four years ago and, to be honest, I wouldn't know where to put another one," he joked at a press conference. 
"It is never my goal to be the top scorer, but rather to be world champion. Of course, it's nice to see your name at the top, but that's no big deal. There is another title which is far more valuable." 
Despite picking up a cut above his right eye in the final moments of Saturday's 2-2 draw with Ghana, Muller expects to play a part in Thursday's final group game, against USA. 
"It looks worse than it is," said the man with 20 international goals from 51 appearances. "The blood came pouring out, but I have no complaints." 
Instead, Muller says Germany's opponents should be worried about facing them. "Every team who comes up against us has to swallow hard," he added. "That was our aim - we wanted to be uncomfortable opponents. 
"We're not a team who play long balls. That's not our style. We like to have more possession and I think we're heading in the right direction."
