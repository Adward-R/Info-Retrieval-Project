Honduras boss Suarez steps down
Honduras coach Luis Suarez has stepped down after a 3-0 defeat to Switzerland saw his team bow out at the group stage of the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ on Wednesday. 
Honduras finished bottom of Group E after three consecutive defeats that also included a 3-0 loss to France and a 2-1 defeat to Ecuador. 
The Central Americans needed to beat Switzerland to have any hope of qualifying for the last 16 but Xherdan Shaqiri's hat-trick dashed any remaining hopes of progress. 
"Unfortunately we didn't get the result we were hoping for (against Honduras)," Suarez said. 
"The whole country is disappointed and I'm sad because we didn't manage to reach the next round. That was our dream. I made the decision to step down five minutes ago. It's time for a change. 
"The new coach has a good squad at his disposal, we've got good young players and we're on the right track. I'll take positive memories from this experience and I'll always be a Honduras fan."
