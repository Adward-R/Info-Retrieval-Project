Semi-final stars draw huge crowds to FIFA Fan Fest™
A semi-final line-up featuring footballing aristocrats Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Netherlands created a huge demand from fans eager to share in the unique experience of the FIFA Fan Fest. 
Hundreds of thousands of revellers crammed the 12 FIFA Fan Fest locations for both semi-final matches. 
And, if Brazil’s shocking exit at the hands of Germany made for some sad faces among Tuesday’s 313,000 visitors, they were back again in force just 24 hours later for another emotional rollercoaster between Netherlands and Argentina.  
Although clearly devastated by their heavy loss, Brazilians demonstrated their love of the game above all else when returning to the Fan Fest sites in large numbers on Wednesday, helping to swell the second semi-final FIFA Fan Fest attendance to over 100,000 fans. 
A total of 416,661 visited FIFA Fan Fests during the two semi-finals, coming together in 12 iconic festival locations that include Farol de Barra in Salvador, Iracema Beach in Fortaleza and, of course, the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. 
In doing so, fans nudged the total FIFA Fan Fest attendance for the tournament to within touching distance of the forecasted five-million mark – a figure now expected to surpass comfortably by the day of the final between Germany and Argentina. 
Tens of thousands of fans from Argentina have followed their team since the tournament kicked-off, and they were again visible in large numbers at the FIFA Fan Fest centres - especially in Rio de Janeiro, where they have been a friendly and vocal force the past four weeks and, today, in the Anhangabau Valley in Sao Paulo. 
Indeed, all four semi-finalists are teams renowned for their large and exuberant travelling support. The yellow of Brazil and Argentina’s 
 may have outnumbered Dutch orange and German black and white
but, at the FIFA Fan Fests, they were never out-sung and definitely not out-partied!
