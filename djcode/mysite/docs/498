Eto'o remains doubt for Cameroon
Cameroon captain Samuel Eto'o remains a serious doubt for Monday's FIFA World Cup™ Group A clash with Brazil in Brasilia as he continues to struggle with a knee injury. 
Eto'o, 33, played no part in training with the rest of the Cameroon squad at the National Stadium. 
The striker injured his right knee in the Indomitable Lions' 1-0 defeat to Mexico in Natal on June 13 and has not trained since, playing no part in the 4-0 loss to Croatia in Manaus last Wednesday. 
That result ended Cameroon's chances of qualifying for the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time since 1990.
