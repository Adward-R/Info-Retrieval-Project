Wonder goal a sweet goodbye for Cahill
Australia's all-time leading goalscorer Tim Cahill believes his stunning volley in the Socceroos' 3-2 defeat to the Netherlands will live long in the memory across the globe. However, it was a bittersweet day for Cahill as Australia were eliminated from the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ and he was booked for the second successive game, which means he will miss his side's last match against Spain due to suspension. 
"That left foot strike, not only for Australia, but the whole of the world will definitely be something we remember forever, not only because what it meant to me but you see the fans here and I've seen the reactions back home," he said. 
Australian actor Hugh Jackman joined famous names from the football world like Rio Ferdinand and Thierry Henry in congratulating Cahill on Twitter. The 34-year-old admitted he has been blown away by the reaction. 
I've had one of the best farewell matches in my life

"The amount of response I have had socially from big personalities has been unbelievable as well," he added. "I've had one of the best farewell matches in my life. I've created something globally that everyone has seen and witnessed and when you have some of the biggest personalities tweeting you I can't ask for more." 
Cahill has now scored five times across three World Cups and although he won't be able to add to his tally, the New York Red Bulls man is backing his teammates to inflict more pain on the already eliminated holders Spain. 
"This is my last World Cup and it was an amazing way to go out. It is what I have always dreamed of and I'll still be kicking every ball on the bench against Spain. We've got one more game to go and it is not about Tim Cahill. This last game is massive. If we beat Spain that will be one of the biggest moments in Australian history."
